<p>The US is in crisis - what about its literature? Michelle Dean reports on the list of American writers to watch this decade, which is as diverse as the country itself</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/granta-list-best-young-american-novelists">The 2017 list in full</a></li></ul><p>It is a strange time to be making declarations about the nature of American writing. The country’s not exactly feeling well. And even before the events of last autumn, it used to be easier to know what people meant when they spoke of Great American Novels. They meant, chiefly, fat realist ones, usually authored by men. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/11/philip-roth-american-pastoral-sabbaths-theater">Philip Roth </a>was the avatar of success in that model. He’d put America in the title, construct his characters around some kind of American archetype, and he was off and running.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/granta-list-best-young-american-novelists">Granta’s list of the best young American novelists</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/granta-pick-best-young-american-authors-great-american-novel">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
<p>Agency, by the famously prescient SF author, imagines an alternative US where voters have elected their first female president </p><p>Science fiction writer William Gibson is to use the dream of a Hillary Clinton win in last year’s US presidential election as the launch point for his next novel. Gibson, who coined the word “cyberspace” in his 1984 debut Neuromancer, will reimagine the world under a Clinton presidency in his next novel Agency, as well as London in the distant future.</p><p>Due out in January 2018, the novel will travel between two periods: one in present-day San Francisco, where Clinton’s White House ambitions are realised; and the other in a post-apocalyptic London, 200 years into the future after 80% of the world population has been killed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/new-william-gibson-novel-world-where-hillary-clinton-won-agency">Continue reading...</a>

<title>Top 10 terrible houses in fiction</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/top-10-terrible-houses-in-fiction
</link>
<description>
<p>Places you’d be desperate to avoid in real life provide a magnetic lure in books by authors from Dickens to Du Maurier and even Richard Adams</p><p>My novel, <a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/clocks-in-this-house-all-tell-different-times.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">The Clocks in This House All Tell Different Times</a>, tells the tale of a girl who travels through a dark forest and arrives at a big house. The forest is bad but the house is arguably worse – a false sanctuary inhabited by decadent aristocrats; boozy and boisterous, on the brink of turning nasty. </p><p>At some point when writing the story, I realised I was naively blundering into a long and noble tradition of books about terrible houses, much as I’ve naively blundered into many awkward, unfamiliar houses down the years. Maybe I love these places in fiction because I hate and fear them in real life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/top-10-terrible-houses-in-fiction">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
Virtual hallucinations and tricksy Matrix-style visions dominate a 21st-century immortality quest<p>It’s late in the 21st century. New York City has drowned, and the reversal of Pacific currents means that Tokyo is freezing. In Saudi Arabia “the mullahs rule piously over blank infernos of sand”. There are armed drones and super-powerful <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/20/robots-racist-sexist-people-machines-ai-language" title="">AIs</a> that have been designed for thousands of generations by other AIs, so that no human understands how they work. The rich have private armies and undergo yearly rejuvenation treat-ments at exclusive clinics. But James Cromwell, an inscrutable billionaire already more than 100 years old, wants more time. And someone unknown has sent him proof of a concept for an elixir of immortality. The question is, what does this party want in return?</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/15/lost-books-odyssey-zachary-mason">The Lost Books of the Odyssey by Zachary Mason | Book review</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/void-star-zachary-mason-review-william-gibson-ai-matrix-immortality">Continue reading...</a>

Into the Water by Paula Hawkins review – how to follow Girl on the Train?
</title>

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/into-the-water-paula-hawkins-review
</link>
<description>
Her debut thriller was a phenomenon, but here an embarrassment of narrators and the clunky withholding of information is death to suspense<p>More accidents happen in the home than anywhere else, a fact to lend some much-needed plausibility to the overworked genre of domestic suspense, or grip-lit as it’s sometimes known. About 60 debut novels cross my desk every year (I&nbsp;chair the <a href="http://harrogateinternationalfestivals.com/news/new-blood-showcase-criminally-good-class-of-2017/" title="">New Blood panel at the Theakston Old Peculier crime writing festival</a>), and for the last three or four years, the&nbsp;proportion of this subgenre has been rising.</p><p>Not a problem in itself: if the books were original, well written or thought-provoking, nobody would be happier than I. But sadly that’s not generally been the case. There have been notable exceptions, of course: clever, suspenseful reads such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/03/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup" title="">Renée Knight’s <em>Disclaimer</em></a> or Ben McPherson’s <em>A Line of Blood</em>. Then there are the mega-sellers such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/20/gillian-flynn-gone-girl-review" title="">Gillian Flynn’s<em> Gone Girl</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/16/before-i-sleep-sj-watson-review" title="">SJ&nbsp;Watson’s <em>Before I Go to Sleep</em></a><em> </em>and Paula Hawkins’s <em>The Girl on the Train</em>, which all gave us interesting twists on the idea of the unreliable narrator.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/into-the-water-paula-hawkins-review">Continue reading...</a>

Move Fast and Break Things by Jonathan Taplin review – the damage done by Silicon Valley

<description>
<p>Taplin’s starting point is the music of Levon Helm and the Band, but the fight against the spoiled brats of Google, Amazon and Facebook is much bigger</p><p>In 2012, Jonathan Taplin took part in a public debate with Alexis Ohanian, the founder of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/reddit" title="">Reddit</a>, about what the digital economy was doing to the creative arts. Taplin, who had once been manager of the Band, and was the producer of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/martinscorsese" title="">Martin Scorsese</a>’s magnificent film of their farewell concert <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/15/last-waltz-heartworn-highways-americana-scorsese-country-music" title=""><em>The Last Waltz</em></a>, had a particular grievance about the fate of his friend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/levon-helm" title="">Levon Helm</a>, the Band’s drummer. Helm was suffering from cancer, but had been forced back on the road at the age of 70 to help pay his medical bills because the new culture of “free music and movies” had destroyed his income as a recording artist. Ohanian, clearly a little chastened by this tale, wrote to Taplin offering to help “make right what the music industry did to members of the Band”. He suggested a reunion concert or album, funded by kickstarter, and launched on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/reddit" title="">Reddit</a>.</p><p>Taplin’s reply, which he reprints here in all its eviscerating glory, points out that this plan won’t work because in the meantime Helm has died. Moreover, he tells Ohanian, “It wasn’t the music industry that created Levon’s plight; it was people like you.” He concludes: “You are so clueless as to offer to get the Band back together for a charity concert, unaware that three of the five members are dead. Take your charity and shove it. Just let us get paid for our work and stop deciding that you can unilaterally make it free.” Ohanian, unsurprisingly, did not respond.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/move-fast-and-break-things-jonathan-taplin-review-damage-silicon-valley">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Small Death, the Saudi novelist’s historical novel about a Sufi mystic and adventurer, takes $50,000 honour for ‘striking artistry’ </p><p>A historical novel about the life and adventures of an Andalusian adventurer and Sufi mystic has taken the most prestigious prize in Arabic fiction.</p><p>Saudi author Mohammed Hasan Alwan won the $50,000 (£39,000) International prize for Arabic fiction for A Small Death, his fictional account of the life of Sunni scholar Muhyiddin Ibn ‘Arabi. The novel follows him from his birth in Muslim Spain in 1165 to his death in Damascus in 1240, taking in journeys from Andalusia to Azerbaijan, and his reflections on the violence witnesses in Morocco, Egypt, the Hejaz (now part of Saudi Arabia), Syria, Iraq and Turkey. A contentious figure in history, Ibn ‘Arabi has been declared the foremost spiritual leader in Sufism by some, but condemned as an apostate by others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/international-prize-for-arabic-fiction-mohammed-hasan-alwan-a-small-death">Continue reading...</a>

Cannery Row may be sentimental but it is far from shallow
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/25/cannery-row-sentimental-shallow-john-steinbeck
</link>
<description>
<p>John Steinbeck’s story of kindness among eccentric unfortunates is full of jokes and fond nostalgia – as well as quiet profundity</p><p>Cannery Row is a “kind of nostalgic thing”, according to John Steinbeck. He wrote it, as he explained in a 1953 essay, “for a group of soldiers who said to me: ‘Write something funny that isn’t about the war. Write something for us to read - we’re sick of war.’”</p><p>If you like, you can take that statement at face value. First, it is a funny book, funny in a way that hasn’t gone stale in the 70 years since its first publication. Jokes about booze and sex and food tend to have a good shelf life. And Steinbeck’s ribald gags have a perennial joy about them, even when he’s talking about something as antiquated as the Model T: “Two generations of Americans knew more about the Ford coil than the clitoris.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/25/cannery-row-sentimental-shallow-john-steinbeck">Continue reading...</a>

<title>Rebecca Swift obituary</title>

</link>
<description>
The pioneering founder of an agency helping writers to get their work published<p>Rebecca Swift, who has died aged 53 of cancer, believed that anyone who writes and wishes to be edited and advised constructively and professionally should have the opportunity to do so. To this end, in 1996 she founded <a href="https://literaryconsultancy.co.uk/" title="">The Literary Consultancy</a> (TLC) with Hannah Griffiths. It was the first of its kind – a manuscript assessment agency offering detailed editorial feedback to anyone writing in English anywhere in the world. Set up in Becky’s north London flat on a capital sum of £600, TLC never borrowed another penny.</p><p>From 1989 to 1995, Becky was a junior editor at <a href="https://www.virago.co.uk/about/" title="">Virago Press</a>. At the time, the “slush pile” – that mountain of unsolicited manuscripts – was one of the first casualties of the editorial department: publishers no longer had the resources to read unsolicited manuscripts, which were returned to the writer with a standard note.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/rebecca-swift-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Elizabeth Gaskell: Charlotte Brontë's unlikely defender against prurient gossip
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/charlotte-bronte-biographer-elizabeth-gaskell
</link>
<description>
<p>Where Gaskell was gregarious and conventional, Brontë was an introverted maverick – but the former did fierce, invaluable work to protect the latter’s reputation</p><p>Here are some reasons to hate Elizabeth Gaskell’s <a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/life-of-charlotte-bronte-2.html">The Life of Charlotte Brontë</a>: it is moralistic and stultifying; it flattens Brontë’s brilliantly transgressive nature and confines her to a saccharine version of Victorian female victimhood. It is inaccurate, overemotional and, at times, libellous towards those she accused of attacking her good friend. You might also criticise Gaskell’s motivations: driven by opportunistic ambition to feed, vulture-like, on the carcass of Brontë’s reputation, rather than a true desire to investigate or memorialise.</p><p> You wouldn’t be the first to say so. Ever since its publication in 1857, Gaskell’s biography has been snarked at for its sins and failings. But there are reasons to cherish it, too: it is a loving defence of the value and power of women’s writing; a biography of a woman was revolutionary at that time; and it is a testament to the constraints placed on female writers and the ways they have found to move beyond them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/charlotte-bronte-biographer-elizabeth-gaskell">Continue reading...</a>

The Good Bohemian: The Letters of Ida John review – the Bloomsbury group laid bare
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/the-good-bohemian-the-letters-of-ida-john-review
</link>
<description>
The letters of Augustus John’s first wife, who forfeited her art for child-rearing and a most unconventional marriage, make for wickedly entertaining reading<p>As Virginia Woolf whimsically calculated, the world became modern “on or about December 1910”. Sadly, that was too late for Ida John, an artistically gifted and boldly emancipated “New Woman” who died in 1907.</p><p>“I must create something,” Ida insisted in a letter to one of her female confidantes; all she asked was “a studio and ability to paint for myself”. But artistic creativity was still a male prerogative and when a teenage girl of her acquaintance said that she too wanted to paint, Ida could only ironically advise her to “be a man”. Ida defied her stuffy family to marry the raffish society portraitist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/sep/04/art">Augustus John</a>, after which her occupation turned out to be breeding. She came to think of herself merely as “a Belly” and thought she had the gooey consistency of a suet pudding. When Gus, as she called him, took up with a mistress named Dorelia, Ida in desperation agreed to cohabit with the minx-like newcomer in an Edwardian seraglio.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/the-good-bohemian-the-letters-of-ida-john-review">Continue reading...</a>

Hostage by Guy Delisle review – held captive by every frame
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/hostage-guy-delisle-graphic-novel-of-the-month-review
</link>
<description>
This true story of a man’s kidnapping in Chechnya confirms Guy Delisle’s position as one of the greatest modern cartoonists<p>In 1997, Christophe André, a young Frenchman who was working as an administrator for Médecins Sans Frontières in Ingushetia in the north Caucasus, was woken in the middle of the night by a gang of armed men. At first, he thought they’d come to raid the NGO’s safe: the next day was pay day and it was bulging with cash. But when they bundled him into a car and drove him over the border into Chechnya, he realised things were perhaps more serious than he had at first believed. The victim of a kidnapping, he would spend the next three months alone in a dark room, handcuffed to a radiator.</p><p>Three months, one room. This is, to say the least, extremely challenging territory for a cartoonist. Somehow, though, Guy Delisle – the French-Canadian artist who is best known for such award-winning travelogues as <em>Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea</em> and <em>Jerusalem: Chronicles from the Holy City</em> – has turned André’s account of his weeks of hell into a gripping visual narrative. The days unfold monotonously, punctuated only by bowls of thin soup and the occasional trip to the bathroom. Of troubled Chechnya and its people we see almost nothing until the book’s final pages, when André makes a daring escape. But in the end, this is of no consequence. In <em>Hostage</em>, it’s the treacherous landscape of the mind that Delisle determinedly makes his own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/hostage-guy-delisle-graphic-novel-of-the-month-review">Continue reading...</a>

A publisher of one's own: Virginia and Leonard Woolf and the Hogarth Press

<description>
<p>A century after the Bloomsbury luminaries took delivery of their own printing equipment, the legacy of their pioneering – and often dramatic – DIY operation lives on</p><p>“We unpacked it with enormous excitement, finally with Nelly’s help carried it into the drawing room, set it on its stand, and discovered that it was smashed in half,” wrote Virginia Woolf on the afternoon of 24 April 1917. That day she and her husband Leonard took delivery of the hand press that heralded the birth of their brainchild, the Hogarth Press. Their £19 purchase had been long awaited, one of three resolutions made while the couple took tea on Virginia’s 33rd birthday: they would buy Hogarth House in Richmond, find a hand press to do their own printing, and buy a bulldog and name him John.</p><p>The missing part needed to fix the press and render it operative arrived several weeks later and the first publication notice, painstakingly hand set by the Woolfs, was sent out in May. In tidy lettering, it bravely announced the imminent publication of a pamphlet titled Two Stories: one each by Virginia and Leonard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/24/a-publisher-of-ones-own-virginia-and-leonard-woolf-and-the-hogarth-press">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
<p>Reissues aim to restore her darker stories of village intrigue for grownups to the popularity they once enjoyed</p><p>Richmal Crompton has long been overshadowed by her creation Just William, but the darker side of her imagination is set to be rediscovered, with several of her lesser-known adult novels coming back into print.</p><p>Although best known for her 38 books about the errant schoolboy William Brown and his gang of Outlaws, Lancashire-born Compton was a prolific writer for both children and adults, often publishing two books a year, as well as writing short stories magazines. “She wrote 41 adult novels as well as the Just William books,” her new publisher Harriet Sanders said. “They did very well at the time and display something that you see in other writers of children’s books … the clarity with which they are written.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/20/not-just-william-richmal-cromptons-adult-fiction-republished">Continue reading...</a>

Proust's complaint about neighbours' loud sex among treasures in French sale

<description>
<p>Letter from ‘jealous’ author, as well as another by Gustave Flaubert defending Madame Bovary will be sold from collection worth an estimated €3m</p><p>A treasure trove of letters and diaries revealing the secrets of some of France’s greatest literary figures is about to go on sale in Paris. Correspondence and journals by Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo and Marcel Proust are among 230 lots to be sold alongside a rare first edition of Galileo’s Discorsi on 26 April.</p><p>Amassed by Geneva-based Jean Bonna, who has been described as the greatest collector of French literature in the world, the collection is a fraction of material acquired over the past 50 years. Bonna said he was streamlining his collection to concentrate on French literature. Admitting he felt “a little bit sad” to sell the Galileo, which is expected to make in excess of €700,000 (£585,000), he added: “It is a wonderful book, and the best copy I have ever seen, but it does not belong in my collection because it is a scientific book and not French literature.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/19/proust-letter-neighbours-loud-sex-treasures-france">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Marvel distances itself from Indonesian artist Ardian Syaf after his images’ apparent reference to fierce religious and political divisions in his country</p><p>An artist who allegedly inserted political and religious messages into an X-Men spinoff comic has apologised, saying his career is over after fans complained about background images in the first issue of X-Men: Gold containing apparent antisemitic and anti-Christian references.</p><p>On Saturday, publisher Marvel said it would remove the artwork from future versions after readers in Indonesia claimed that some images contained coded messages referring to political and religious tensions in the country. They alleged Indonesian artist Ardian Syaf had sneaked in references to hardline Islamist opposition to Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the first Christian governor of the Indonesian capital in half a century.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/11/x-men-illustrator-alleged-anti-christian-messages-marvel-ardian-syaf">Continue reading...</a>

Enough David Foster Wallace, already! We need to read beyond our bubbles

<description>
<p>Male critics have long expounded a literary canon that mirrors their own lives. Such narrow reading is not restricted to men, but their example is a caution</p><p>After centuries of being told by men what is good and what is bad, what is art and what is garbage, what is important and what is trivial, women have decided to fight against this with a form of writing that can best be summarised as “Ack! Men!” The latest entry in this medium is an Electric Lit essay called <a href="https://electricliterature.com/men-recommend-david-foster-wallace-to-me-7889a9dc6f03">Men Recommend David Foster Wallace to Me</a>, where a woman who was told by several men that she might enjoy the Infinite Jest author’s work explains that no, she does not enjoy it and this is interesting because, you know, Ack! Men!</p><p>This would not even merit a response – except that so many people assumed that it did. Women on social media responded with their own Ack! Men! chorus and some men, so delightfully oblivious, chimed in with things along the lines of: “Infinite Jest is actually a really important book and if you read it you would understand.” That obliviousness does indeed make one want to yell ACK! out the window and into the night, but hopefully we can find something else to say.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/21/enough-david-foster-wallace-already-we-need-to-read-beyond-our-bubbles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Donald Trump loves Reasons to Vote Democrat, a volume of white space that follows a number of liberal spoofs with the same content. I prefer less vacant jokes</p><p>It’s a product worthy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH-E6J5TJTY">Reggie Perrin’s Grot shop</a> – the store opened to sell tat in David Nobbs’s magnificent satire of modern life: a book called <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-trump-book-joke-20170417-story.html">Reasons to Vote Democrat by Michael J Knowles</a>, which contains only a smattering of words – title page, contents and chapter headings – in its 265 pages. The rest is blank.</p><p>“Ho! Ho! Ho!” tweeted president Donald Trump as <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/853944453538750464">his recommendation</a> sent Reasons to Vote Democrat up the bestseller charts. It isn’t the only blank book produced on the back of current divisions in US politics: Oregon Democrat Cylvia Hayes got there first, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Surprising-Reasons-Believe-Trump-President/dp/0991068947">Surprising Reasons to Think That Trump Will Be a (Bigly) Great President!</a> – 150 pages, entirely blank.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/18/empty-satire-the-regrettable-rise-of-blank-paged-books-in-the-trump-era">Continue reading...</a>

John Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat is not for 'literary slummers'
</title>

</link>
<description>
<p>This story of easygoing, thirsty <em>paisanos</em> was an immediate hit with readers who found the characters ‘quaint’, and made the author regret his creation</p><p>Tortilla Flat was the book that made John Steinbeck’s name – and his fortune. By the time it was published in May 1935, he’d managed to publish four other books, but they had been poorly received. He was in his 30s, close to the breadline, living in a house his father had given him and largely dependent on his wife’s paychecks.</p><p>And then the reviews started rolling in for Tortilla Flat. The San Francisco Chronicle called it “exceptionally fine”. “Not since the days of <a draggable="true" href="https://americanliterature.com/author/w-w-jacobs/bio-books-stories">WW Jacobs</a> making his charming characters out of scoundrels has there been a book quite like this one,” said the New Republic. The Spectator suggested that the book might make “a wet afternoon wetter for its readers”, as they cried both with laughter and sadness. The Saturday Review admired its “facile style and the whimsical humour underlying its sharp and clear-cut presentation of character”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/18/john-steinbecks-tortilla-flat-is-not-for-literary-slummers">Continue reading...</a>

Call me British, American, Jewish, Londoner – just don’t call me patriotic | Will Self
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/14/british-american-jewish-londoner-will-self
</link>
<description>
<p>It is a delusional form of patriotism that lies behind the ‘populism’ of recent political upheavals</p><p>It must be a great feeling – at once warm and calming, a sense of profound belonging, of inclusion into the greater group, and through that to the very land itself. At the same time, it must be a rousing feeling – stirring, even – especially when certain key cues are introduced: flapping flags, largo music, marching men, a familiar profile on a reviewing stand. I can see&nbsp;for myself that the reaction is Pavlovian: the eyes water, the heart fills, the head swims. There must be a&nbsp;sense of justness – that you’re a component part of a great and ongoing historical development, one that can only progress towards a kind of civic perfection. Yes, it must be a great feeling, this patriotism of which people speak; and yet, for myself, I’ve never experienced it. My own compromised nationality may be to blame, at least in part – my father was British (at least to begin with), and my mother American. I was born in the old Charing Cross Hospital in central London, and for most of my life I’ve cleaved to my identity as a Londoner, rather than any other. My mother registered me as a US citizen at birth – but I never made any use of this status until after 9/11, when it became nigh impossible for those such as myself (with minor and very old convictions for drug offences) to get&nbsp;a visa on a British passport.</p><p>At JFK airport they questioned my citizenship with this fructuous question: 'Mr Self, are you an apple or a pear?'</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/14/british-american-jewish-londoner-will-self">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bardic men behaving badly, from Lord Byron to Robert Lowell, are traditionally excused – while women poets are written off if they step out of line </p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/11/unseen-sylvia-plath-letters-claim-domestic-abuse-by-ted-hughes">News: Unseen Plath letters claim domestic abuse by Ted Hughes</a></p><p>While Sylvia Plath’s verse is peppered with allusions to the tempestuous domesticity of her marriage to Ted Hughes, he has retained his reputation. Beyond legal concerns, there are tricky factors to consider: the ambiguity of intimacy in general, the fragile and synergistic creativity of both poets, and the ultimate decision of the one who remained – Hughes – to destroy the last journal and correspondence of Plath, who didn’t. The sum of it all has been the calcification of two camps: those who do not see Hughes’s poetic genius as exculpating his behaviour, and the others who see it as exactly that.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/11/unseen-sylvia-plath-letters-claim-domestic-abuse-by-ted-hughes">Unseen Sylvia Plath letters claim domestic abuse by Ted Hughes</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/12/sylvia-plath-letters-ted-hughes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The novelist’s Essex Serpent is getting its own beer, which makes you wonder what other marketing opportunities books could offer</p><p>A rich, copper-hued bitter with “hints of roasted nuts and floral aromas” may not have been the first thing that readers thought of as they settled into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/16/the-essex-serpent-sarah-perry-review-novel">Sarah Perry’s The Essex Serpent</a>. But her publisher Serpent’s Tale hopes an ale from East Anglia’s Saffron Brewery <a href="https://twitter.com/SaffronBrewery/status/850824414241452037">created to mark the book’s paperback launch this month</a> will entice beer drinkers to imbibe the much-praised novel, too.</p><p>Books and beverages have a long, intertwined relationship. Who doesn’t love a pint, or tea – or a pint of tea – while reading? It is rare, however, for the delights created in the kitchens of authors’ imaginations to inspire real-life concoctions available in supermarkets. Which is sad, as novelists often have readers’s mouths watering; in fact, one cannot help but wonder why the grey suits in food and drink marketing haven’t turned to literature for delicious inspiration before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/13/essex-serpent-sarah-perry-literary-food-books">Continue reading...</a>

The new age of Ayn Rand: how she won over Trump and Silicon Valley

<p>Her novel The Fountainhead is one of the few works of fiction that Donald Trump likes and she has long been the darling of the US right. But only now do her devotees hold sway around the world</p><p>As they plough through their GCSE revision, UK students planning to take politics A-level in the autumn can comfort themselves with this thought: come September, they will be studying one thinker who does not belong in the dusty archives of ancient political theory but is achingly on trend. For the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504014/Politics_A_level_content.pdf" title="">curriculum</a> includes a new addition: the work of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/ayn-rand" title="">Ayn Rand</a>.</p><p>It is a timely decision because Rand, who died in 1982 and was alternately ridiculed and revered throughout her lifetime, is having a moment. Long the poster girl of a particularly hardcore brand of free-market fundamentalism – the advocate of a philosophy she called “<a href="https://www.aynrand.org/novels/virtue-of-selfishness" title="">the virtue of selfishness</a>” – Rand has always had acolytes in the conservative political classes. The Republican speaker of the US House of&nbsp;Representatives, Paul Ryan, is so committed a Randian, he was famous for <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/the-ryan-paradox-rand-hayek-080235" title="">giving every new member of his staff</a> a copy of Rand’s gargantuan novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/mar/27/ayn-rand-atlas-shrugged" title="">Atlas Shrugged</a> (along with Freidrich Hayek’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/12/paul-ryan-enslaves-friedrich-hayek-road-serfdom" title="">Road to Serfdom</a>). The story, oft-repeated, that his colleague in the US Senate, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul" title="">Rand Paul</a>, owes his first name to his father Ron’s adulation of Ayn (it rhymes with “mine”) turns out to be apocryphal, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD-R_OeP6tU" title="">Paul describes himself as a fan all&nbsp;the same</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/10/new-age-ayn-rand-conquered-trump-white-house-silicon-valley">Continue reading...</a>

The riddle of Donald Trump: how a man of few words reached the pinnacle of power
</title>

<description>
<p>From ‘bigly’ to tweetspeak – the US president’s vocabulary is ripe for satire</p><p>The Reader’s Digest used to run a feature called It Pays to Increase Your Word Power. The new wisdom – post-Trump and Brexit – is that it doesn’t. How Donald Trump has come so far with so few words – how he even managed to keep up conversationally with all those beauty queens – is a question I don’t expect ever to be solved. Which isn’t to say we haven’t been confronted with similar conundrums before. “The President of the United States has so singular a combination of defects for the office of a constitutional magistrate,” wrote the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1866/09/the-johnson-party/518748/">Atlantic magazine of Andrew Johnson in 1866</a>, “that he could have obtained the opportunity to misrule the nation only by a visitation of Providence.” It is too early to say whether Trump will misrule the nation, and any such speculation is not the object of this article. Andrew Johnson, by all accounts, did have words and, on occasion, even eloquence. This doesn’t detract from the ugliness of his views, but it partially explains how he came by his opportunity.

Don’t say divorce, say special relationship: the thorny language of Brexit
</title>

</link>
<description>
Using soap opera-style breakup metaphors to describe Britain’s EU departure is part of a cheapening of politics<p>Don’t call Brexit a divorce, said Theresa May recently. “I prefer not to use the term of&nbsp;divorce from the European Union because very often when people get divorced they don’t have a very good relationship afterwards,” she explained to parliament. And indeed, in her subsequent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/mar/29/theresa-may-article-50-letter-annotated" title="">passive-aggressive article 50 letter</a> to European council president Donald Tusk, she insisted Britain was the EU’s “closest friend and neighbour”, albeit a friend who was storming out of the EU dinner party because he didn’t like the number of foreigners among the guests. At the same time, the friend was whining over his shoulder that he really wanted a “deep and special partnership” in the future – a phrase repeated in May’s letter an embarrassingly needy six times.</p><p>May’s comment, however, did not stop everyone and their dog from continuing to call Brexit a divorce. It would necessarily be a “painful” divorce after 40 years of marriage, though some said the marriage had always been “loveless” and others hoped its ending could still be “amicable”. But what exactly is the change in our status going to mean, romantically speaking? It would certainly be accounted odd if a married couple were to get divorced just so they could then enter into a “deep” and “special” civil partnership.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/07/brexit-language-divorce-special-relationship-negotiation-britain-eu">Continue reading...</a>

<title>Can you judge a book by its odour?</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/07/the-smell-of-old-books-science-libraries
</link>
<description>
<p>Cocoa, wood, rusks – every book has a distinctive smell. And each smell says something about how and when it was made, and where it has been</p><p>What does it mean to experience a book? To a bibliophile such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/25/curiosity-alberto-manguel-review-philosophy">Alberto Manguel</a>, smell plays an important part. In a talk at the British Library this week, the one-time protege of Jorge Luis Borges and director of the National Library of Argentina said he was particularly partial to old Penguin paperbacks, which he loved for their odour of “fresh rusk biscuits”.</p><p>Audience members responded with their own sense impressions. Peter, a pensioner, said he experienced books as smelling of salt and pepper – “that dryness when you open the cupboard … with a touch of the sea”, while 46-year-old Donna confessed that she had recently bought a book for her young son partly because it “smelled of the rain”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/07/the-smell-of-old-books-science-libraries">Continue reading...</a>

<title>Why Ruby Tandoh has been cooking up a storm</title>

<description>
<p>The 2013 Bake Off finalist has fired off a series of tweets attacking celebrity cooks including Tom Kerridge, Jamie Oliver and the Hairy Bikers. So why all the culinary jibes about fad diets?</p><p>At 8am on Easter Monday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/17/enjoy-food-nourishes-mind-body-eating-disorder">Ruby Tandoh’s Guardian article urging a joyous, guilt-free attitude to food appeared online</a>. The 2013 <em>Bake Off</em> finalist shared it on Twitter, then joyously fired off a series of tweets attacking a slew of celebrity cooks and diet-mongers. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-kerridge">Tom Kerridge</a>’s carb-cutting dopamine diet bestseller was “total bollocks”. Buying a co-written Hemsley sisters’ offering meant “half the fucking brain cells for double the price”. Joe Wicks was “bish bash boshing himself to a multi million £££ turnover”. Even the beloved Jamie Oliver, Hairy Bikers and Lorraine Pascale were accused of “swinging from ‘comfort food’ to ‘superfood’ and back again whenever the price is right”.</p><p>Jibes at culinary rivals are nothing new. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gordonramsay">Gordon Ramsay </a>has sparred with Oliver and Marco Pierre White. Anthony Bourdain is a serial chef slicer. Delia Smith, queen of the 90s, slated Gary Rhodes and Antony Worrall Thompson – both retaliated – and later <em>MasterChef</em>’s judges. Raymond Blanc bashed <em>Bake Off</em> although he then said sorry (criticised by him for “female tears”, Tandoh told him, “don’t be an idiot”, warming up for her post-series jab at “peacocking manchild” Paul Hollywood). Even cooking’s Queen Mum, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/mary-berry">Mary Berry</a>, has said she wouldn’t eat at Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck and was seen as dissing Delia in noting that Smith “hasn’t had the advantage of having children [and so their feedback] like I have”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/20/why-ruby-tandoh-has-been-cooking-up-a-storm-over-fad-diets">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Authors feel betrayed if readers jump forward in their stories – but it may actually enhance appreciation of their work</p><p>Want to upset a novelist? Tell them you always read the end of a book when you are halfway through reading.</p><p>Not only will you be marked down as a philistine, you will be condemned as someone whose disregard for the order in which they intended their book to be read makes you unfit to read it at all. That, at least, was the reaction to my unwitting confession to this habit recently.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/19/lose-the-plot-why-you-should-skip-to-the-end-of-books">Continue reading...</a>

Durga Chew-Bose: 'I don't really believe in writing as catharsis'

<description>
<p>Too Much and Not the Mood is a lyrical collection of essays considering the human heart from many angles. She explains why she writes without a plan</p><p>“The best ideas outrun me. That’s why I write,” Durga Chew-Bose muses in the opening essay of her first book, Too Much and Not the Mood. The relatively slim volume is packed with 14 evocative pieces that evidence that chase – from her childhood growing up in Montreal to her 20s in Brooklyn.<br></p><p>Just as Joan Didion homes in on small physical details, Chew-Bose loves painstakingly specific descriptions. In the sprawling, 90-page essay Heart Museum – named after an emoji – colours are “shell-pink” and a “lathery shade of peach”; a glass window doesn’t shatter, it is “veined”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/13/durga-chew-bose-too-much-and-not-enough-interview">Continue reading...</a>

The 100 best nonfiction books of all time: No 64 – Walden by Henry David Thoreau (1854)

<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/24/100-best-nonfiction-books-walden-henry-david-thoreau
</link>

This account of one man’s rejection of American society has influenced generations of free thinkers<p>On Independence Day 1845, an idealistic young American (Thoreau was just 28) turned his back on what he saw as his country’s depressing materialism, its commercial and industrial soullessness and took himself off to a life of solitude in a country cabin near Walden Pond, just outside Concord, Massachusetts. In his famous account of this experiment, Thoreau later wrote:</p><p>“I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/24/100-best-nonfiction-books-walden-henry-david-thoreau">Continue reading...</a>

Hanif Kureishi: ‘Britain’s middle class is more racist now than ever’

<description>
<p>The My Beautiful Laundrette writer on Brexit Britain, collaborating with his sons and seeing his seventh novel as a B movie</p><p>The afternoon I meet Hanif Kureishi seems fittingly ominous, with dark skies and swirling wind a reflection of the&nbsp;political weather. Over in Westminster, Theresa May is busy triggering Article 50, and fulfilling the will of the British people (little did we know, of course, what further turbulence was to come, with the election called this week). Meanwhile, Kureishi and I set up shop in a jolly brasserie in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, with polished wood and a chequerboard floor; he sips a glass of red, I chug an espresso and, despite the day, there is something cheerfully European about the whole scene.</p><p>There’s also something about Kureishi that chimes with the mood of&nbsp;the times: laconic and deadpan in manner, he alternates between intense seriousness and comical flippancy; there’s a sort of throwaway, geezer donnishness to him. Here we are, he points out with relish, “the hated metropolitan elite”, as if it is chiefly a matter of naughtiness, of occupying the countercultural margins. But at the close of our conversation, when I ask him if there’s anything he would like to&nbsp;expand on, he becomes focused and&nbsp;exact: race, he says, is the thing he thinks and worries about the most. He refers to the Britain of his youth and early adulthood (he is now 62), which he memorably charted in early work such as <em>My Beautiful Laundrette</em>, <em>Sammy and&nbsp;Rosie Get Laid</em> and <em>The Buddha of&nbsp;Suburbia</em>; the waning of the racism of&nbsp;early multiculturalism and of the emergence of London, “a new idea”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/21/hanif-kureishi-interview-britain-middle-class-more-racist">Continue reading...</a>

Translating Agatha Christie into Icelandic: 'One clue took 10 years'

<description>
<p>The author explains how rendering the great English thriller writer into his own language taught him how to write fiction himself</p><p>I was 17 when I started working on my first Icelandic translation of an Agatha Christie novel. I had been reading her books for years and had already translated a few of her short stories for Icelandic magazines, but I was astonished when her publishers offered me the opportunity to translate a whole novel. I was even more delighted when they agreed to let me start with Endless Night (little did they know that my suggestion was because it contained far fewer pages than any other Christie novel I had come across).<br tabindex="-1"></p><p>I would never have guessed that 15 years later I would be writing myself, and have 14 translated Christie novels to my name. Through college, law school, and even when I had started full-time work as a lawyer, I never stopped translating her. Each new title was another chance to immerse myself in her writing and to learn from her as much as I could. And translating her gave me the confidence to write a novel of my own. Christie was not just an inspiration for my writing, but a support.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/04/translating-agatha-christie-into-icelandic-one-clue-took-10-years">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Use the Swedish concept of lagom and you will live 10 years longer – if you don’t die first’</p><p>Here in Sweden we’re getting a bit fed up with our neighbours.

Dava Sobel: ‘If you enjoy detective mysteries, you would love rummaging through archives’

<description>
<p>The author on the researching the lives of pioneer female astronomers who worked at Harvard Observatory</p><p>Many of my writing days are research days. While working on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/08/the-glass-universe-dava-sobel-review"><em>The Glass Universe</em></a>, such days typically began early enough to catch the 7am bus from Northampton, Massachusetts, where I was living while teaching at Smith College, to Boston’s South station – a trip of two to three hours. Then I took the T Red line a few stops to Harvard Square in Cambridge, walked to the Pusey Library, and down to the basement headquarters of the Harvard University archives. The enchanted reading room, where visiting scholars gain access to the vast holdings of historical materials, opens at 11am, and stays open for only five hours a day, five days a week. To make every available moment count, I ate a series of snacks en route so I wouldn’t need to break for lunch. (Food and drink are anathema in the reading room, ditto mints and gum.) On good days, I did not even break to go to the ladies’.</p><p>Archival research strikes some people as boring or burdensome. You occasionally hear writers bemoaning the time they spent “toiling in dusty archives”. But in truth, it’s great fun. If you enjoy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/12/how-to-solve-cryptic-crossword-clues">crosswords</a> or detective mysteries, you would thrive on rummaging through archives. One never knows what treasures will emerge from the numbered containers that the archivists deliver to one’s table. For example, although I had a good idea of what I’d find inside the two boxes labelled “HUGFP 125.2 <a href="http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua12001">Annie Jump Cannon Diaries</a>,” I was stunned to discover a tattered trove of small volumes – some gilt-edged and leather-bound with lock and key, others plain as pocket memo pads – bearing the handwritten reminiscences from a 45-year career at the Harvard Observatory. The original correspondence files proved just as engrossing as the diaries. The philanthropist Catherine Wolfe Bruce, though she lived in a New York City mansion and made charitable contributions for amounts such as $50,000, showed an endearing frugality in her use of the blue notepaper monogrammed with her deceased brother’s initials.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/my-writing-day-dava-sobel">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
<p>Ahead of a public reading, Philippe Sands explores the lessons of Levi’s humanity-filled holocaust memoir</p><p>I was 19 when I first read <em>If This Is a Man</em>, and the book filled a gap created by the shadows cast across an otherwise happy childhood home by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/27/auschwitz-short-history-liberation-concentration-camp-holocaust">Auschwitz</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/20/samuel-willenberg-survivor-of-nazi-death-camp-treblinka-dies-aged-93">Treblinka</a>: my maternal grandparents, rare survivors of the horrors, never talked about their experiences or those who were disappeared, and in this way Levi’s account spoke directly, and personally, offering a fuller sense of matters for which words were not permitted. His has not been the only such book – there are others, including more recent works such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/31/holocaust-thomas-buergenthal-hay-festival">Thomas Buergenthal</a>’s <em>A Lucky Child</em>, Göran Rosenberg’s <em>A Brief Stop on the Road from Auschwit</em>z, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/09/but-you-did-not-come-back-marceline-loridan-ivens-review">Marceline Loridan-Ivans’s <em>But You Did Not Come Back</em></a> – but it was the first. He was a messenger of detail, allowing me to see and feel matters of dread and horror: waiting for a deportation order; travelling in a cattle cart by train; descending a ramp for selection; imagining what it must be like to know you are about to be gassed and cremated; struggling for survival surrounded by people you love and hate.</p><p>Levi’s voice was especially affecting, so clear, firm and gentle, yet humane and apparently untouched by anger, bitterness or self-pity. <em>If This Is a Man</em> is miraculous, finding the human in every individual who traverses its pages, whether a <em>Häftling</em> (prisoner) or <em>Muselmann</em> (“the weak, the inept, those doomed to selection”), a kapo or a guard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/primo-levi-auschwitz-if-this-is-a-man-memoir-70-years">Continue reading...</a>

The Shortest History of Germany review – probing an enigma at the heart of Europe

<description>
James Hawes’s brief yet rewarding history of Germany examines its place in a continent in the throes of upheaval<p>In AD843, Charlemagne’s grandsons divided his empire like mafia bosses parcelling out territory. Louis received the land we were to later call Germany. A large part of it had been in the Roman empire, lying behind the Limes Germanicus, the great wall the Romans built to keep out the barbarians to the east. Cologne, Stuttgart, Vienna, Bonn, Mainz and Frankfurt, all the greatest cities of the future West Germany and Austria, with the exception of Hamburg, grew up within or in the immediate shadow of Rome’s western&nbsp;empire.</p><p>Louis knew where his kingdom began – Germany began at the Rhine, of course. He knew, too, that at its heart were territories that were now Catholic lands and had once been part of the Roman empire. But where did Germany end? He wasn’t sure, nor was anyone else. The Treaty of Verdun, which managed the partition, simply assigned Louis “everything beyond the Rhine”. It left open the question of where “everything” stopped. Did Germany end at the Elbe, where Charlemagne’s rule had stopped, or could it go on into the Slav lands to the east, whose rulers had paid tribute to Charlemagne?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/24/the-shortest-history-of-germany-review-james-hawes-mystery-heart-of-europe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Charles Saumarez Smith’s ‘connoisseur’s’ tour of the East End is enjoyable but unashamedly whimsical</p><p>Who will admit to being a gentrifier? Who will confess to being part of that rent-inflating urban scourge, over which so many hands are wrung, that lays a plague of artisanal bread and absurd beards upon the land, which like the enclosures of yore sends widows and orphans and honest craftsmen weeping into exile? Who will sing that they’re glad to gentrify?</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/11/royal-academy-of-arts-redevelopment-plans-revealed-burlington-house">Charles Saumarez Smith</a>, that’s who. The secretary and chief executive of the Royal Academy of Arts, owner of a double-fronted Georgian house in Stepney – before that a terrace house in Limehouse, bought in 1982 – lets you know in the very first sentence of his book on east London, with lack of cant, that he is not your traditional cockney diamond geezer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/24/east-london-charles-saumarez-smith-review">Continue reading...</a>

Strange Labyrinth by Will Ashon review – summoning the spirits of Epping Forest

<description>
A cast of highwaymen, psychics and joggers populates Will Ashon’s glorious foray into the London woodland<p>Ten years ago, you couldn’t walk 10 paces in Hackney or Peckham without bumping into a <em>flâneur</em> botanising the tarmac, but as London continues to gentrify even the psychogeographers are being moved out. Many London writers now seem more interested in the edge of things than the centre.</p><p>One such is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/26/will-ashon-epping-forest-value-to-being-lost">Will Ashon</a> and his first work of nonfiction, <em>Strange Labyrinth</em>, is an anarchic hymn to the scruffy edgeland of Epping Forest, the ancient wood that sits on the boundary between London and Essex. The forest was “saved for the nation” by the Corporation of London in 1878, “in effect making it the UK’s first national park”, but what was once a cockney paradise is now attractive mainly to dog walkers, joggers, doggers and cruisers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/23/strange-labyrinth-will-ashon-review">Continue reading...</a>

Deviate: The Science of Seeing Differently by Beau Lotto review – why we need brain control
</title>

<description>
<p>A neuroscientist argues that all experience occurs in the brain – and that the brain is deluded</p><p>Beau Lotto is a gung-ho neuroscientist. “[The] great minds of history,” he says, “had theories, but now neuroscience has an answer.” The latest research has, it seems, established that everything you experience “takes place in the brain” and that “you never, ever see reality!” (Lotto loves his italics and exclamation marks.) Your brain may be beautiful, but “what makes it beautiful is that it is delusional” and you should therefore get shot of your inhibitions and summon the courage to “deviate!”</p><p>Perhaps we should back up a little. Early in the book, Lotto mentions a French scientist called Michel Chevreul who started working at the Gobelins textile factory in Paris in the 1820s. Chevreul had to deal with complaints about coloured yarns that seemed to fade after being woven into tapestries, and his patient chemical analyses did not get him anywhere. But then he shifted his attention from the science of dyestuffs to the psychology of perception, and he was on the way to a solution: colours, he discovered, change their appearance when looked at side by side.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/deviate-the-science-of-seeing-differently-by-beau-lotto-review">Continue reading...</a>

We Know All About You by Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones review – the dangers of our surveillance society

<description>
<p>A readable history of snooping in Britain and US argues that private spying organisations have done as much harm as the state<br></p><p>When the US government contractor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden">Edward Snowden</a> disclosed the extent of the global eavesdropping operation being run by the National Security Agency, GCHQ and their partners in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, many people spoke, aghast, of the way in which the 21st century appeared to have ushered in a new age of surveillance.</p><p>Yet spying on a mass scale has of course been with us for as long as governments have been skittish about foreign powers or uncertain about the loyalties of their own citizens. When Oliver Cromwell established the Post Office as a state monopoly in 1657, he did so not because he wished to improve England’s communications, but because the opening of mail was considered to be “the best means to discover and prevent any dangerous and wicked designs against the Commonwealth”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/we-know-all-about-you-rhodri-jeffreys-jones-review">Continue reading...</a>

Irresistible by Adam Alter review – an entertaining look at technology addiction
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/21/irresistible-by-adam-alter-review-technology-addiction
</link>
<description>
<p>This examination of today’s tech-zombie epidemic is worth putting your phone down for – at least for a while</p><p>Are you addicted to technology? I’m certainly not. In my first sitting reading Adam Alter’s <em>Irresistible</em>, an investigation into why we can’t stop scrolling and clicking and surfing online, I only paused to check my phone four times. Because someone might have emailed me. Or texted me. One time I&nbsp;stopped to download an app Alter mentioned (research) and the final time I had to check the shares on my play brokerage app, Best Brokers (let’s&nbsp;call this one “business”).</p><p>Half the developed world is addicted to something, and Alter, a professor at New York University, informs us that, increasingly, that something isn’t drugs or alcohol, but behaviour. Recent studies suggest the most compulsive behaviour we engage in has to do with cyber connectivity; 40% of us have some sort of internet-based addiction – whether it’s checking your email (on average workers check it 36 times an hour), mindlessly scrolling through other people’s breakfasts on Instagram or gambling online.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/21/irresistible-by-adam-alter-review-technology-addiction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A bravura account asks whether recent terrorist atrocities represent the radicalisation of Islam or nihilism in search of an alibi</p><p>Are the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad responsible for modern jihadism, or does the terrorists’ ignorance of their religion show that Islam is cover for inner disquiets that make more sense to the psychologist than the imam?

The Enemy Within by Sayeeda Warsi review – a thrilling and satisfying polemic

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/20/enemy-within-sayeeda-warsi-review-thrilling-satisfying-polemic
</link>
<description>
<p>The first Muslim woman to serve in a British cabinet makes a powerful case against the government’s anti-terrorism policy</p><p>Sayeeda Warsi’s father arrived in northern England from Pakistan with less than £3 in his pocket and built a&nbsp;£2m-a-year bed-manufacturing business. His daughter qualified as a lawyer and became the first Muslim woman to be a&nbsp;member of the cabinet. Despite all this, she has been subjected to the insult of being perceived as “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/03/the-enemy-within-tale-of-muslim-britain-sayeeda-warsi-review">the&nbsp;enemy within</a>”, and finds herself wondering whether the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/25/sayeeda-warsi-where-are-my-grandkids-going-to-call-home-what-world-will-they-grow-up-in">UK will still be a home for her grandchildren</a>. It is this personal stake that gives her forthright and intelligent book its sense of urgency. By&nbsp;tackling the “Muslim problem” head on, Lady Warsi has added to her accomplishments the feat of speaking truth to power.</p><p>She argues that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/05/british-muslims-7-july-london-bombings">7/7 bombing</a> became the basis of bad policy, extending pre-charge detention; terrorism in the name of Islam was treated differently from others forms of terrorism. By replacing multiculturalism with British values as the yardstick by which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/14/muslims-class-islam-citizen-britain">Muslims were measured</a>, the path was set for the present state of disengagement between government and community. “In an attempt to build a more cohesive and resilient society,” she laments, “we demanded that ‘the Muslims’ join what we believed we stood for rather than jointly charting a&nbsp;route to what we wanted to be”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/20/enemy-within-sayeeda-warsi-review-thrilling-satisfying-polemic">Continue reading...</a>

London’s Triumph by Stephen Alford review – merchant adventurers and Tudor boomtime
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/20/londons-triumph-by-stephen-alford-review
</link>
<description>
<p>This fresh account of the rise of the English capital as a global metropolis never loses sight of the city’s searing inequality</p><p>Inside <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/samuelpepys">Samuel Pepys</a>’ favourite church, St Olave’s on Hart Street, stand monuments to aldermen, mercers, knights of the realm and directors of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/04/east-india-company-original-corporate-raiders">East India Company</a>. Out in the churchyard, via a gateway studded with stone skulls – “like a jail”, wrote Dickens, who renamed the place St Ghastly Grim – are the plague victims. They lie alongside “a man blackamore”, found dead in the street in 1588, and two African maidservants of a Jewish-born Portuguese physician. Interred here, too, are the scant remains of an Inuit baby, who perished within weeks of being taken from Baffin Island, Canada, by the explorer Martin Frobisher. Here, in microcosm, is Tudor London, a city of commerce, immigration, adventure, disease, celebrity, curiosity, money, power and risk. As Stephen Alford makes clear, “London was both a triumph of riches and a triumph of poverty.” This is a book about travel, trade and the rise of London as a global metropolis, but it does not neglect the churchyard.</p><p>In 1500, London was marginal and underwhelming. Paris had more people; Antwerp had bigger markets; Augsburg in Bavaria had the bankers and Florence the art. London didn’t even have a bourse. A century later, the city was booming. Her population had quadrupled and her river teemed with ships full of caviar, tobacco and silk. She had a Royal Exchange and a global reach. In Arctic waters seamen encountered islands called Cape Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth’s Foreland and Charing Cross, which was just south of West England. “Not an infant of the curtailed skinclipping pagans but talk of London as frequently as of their Prophet’s tomb at Mecca,” wrote the satirist Thomas Nashe in 1599. Such a statement could not even have been conjured at the beginning of the century.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/20/londons-triumph-by-stephen-alford-review">Continue reading...</a>

Jonathan Taplin reveals how just three companies subverted the internet’s utopian ideals<p>The internet, <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2013/01/30-years-tcp-and-ip-everything" title="">defined as the network switched on in January 1983</a>, is now 34 years old. When it began, it was a gloriously decentralised, creative, non-commercial system that evoked in many of its early users utopian hopes about liberation, empowerment, creativity and sticking it to The Man. In those heady days, only a few sceptics wondered how long it would take for capitalism to get a grip on it. Now we know: it took only 21 years.</p><p>Opinions vary about the timing, of course. For my money, the critical year was 2004, the year Google had its IPO, Facebook was launched and the business model that became known as “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754" title="">surveillance capitalism</a>” really got a grip on the network. This is the model that provides supposedly free services to users in return for “consent” to mine and exploit their personal data and digital trails in order to target adverts at them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/17/move-fast-and-break-things-review-google-facebook-amazon-exposed">Continue reading...</a>

Che, My Brother by Juan Martin Guevara review – the making of a revolutionary

</link>
<description>
A sibling’s affectionate account of the formative years of Che Guevara offers a compelling insight<p>One could argue that sufficient ink has been expended on Che Guevara. Those who fought with him, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/28/biography.features">Fidel Castro</a>, have written memoirs, and there’s a definitive biography by the reporter who located Che’s body, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lee_Anderson">Jon Lee Anderson</a>. But, as Anderson himself says, wherever there is revolt or resistance, there is still that face: of the hero-revolutionary Bolivian nuns called “San Ernesto”. And there still exists an insatiable desire for more about the man behind the T-shirt or poster, especially when it comes from his family.</p><p>Ernesto Guevara, “El Che”, was 15 when his younger brother Juan Martin was born, about to set off on the first of his adventures, by electrically powered bicycle, then motorbike, then the boat Granma, on which he sailed from Mexico to help ignite and lead the Cuban revolution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/16/che-my-brother-juan-martin-guevara-review">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
<p>Patience Ibrahim and co-writer Andrea C Hoffmann craft a vivid and valuable account of trauma and survival</p><p>This harrowing book, subtitled How I Escaped With My Daughter from Boko Haram, tells the story of newly pregnant 19-year-old Nigerian Patience, whose husband and mother were murdered by militants. One day, she is kidnapped by Boko Haram and her ordeal is recounted in unflinching detail: the beatings, rapes and torture meted out to her and fellow prisoners and how she escaped and survived with her baby daughter, Gift. The book is co-written with Andrea C Hoffmann, a journalist and expert on victim traumatisation, and switches between Hoffmann’s account of visiting Nigeria, the challenges of interviewing Patience about her painful past and vivid accounts from Patience herself. Translated by Shaun Whiteside, this is a valuable document, contributing raw experience of terror, trauma and recovery, as well as insight into the techniques of telling the most traumatic of stories.</p><p>• <em>A Gift from Darkness</em> by Patience Ibrahim and Andrea C Hoffmann is published by Little, Brown (£13.99).

<description>
<p>Donna Seaman resurrects forgotten artists and their work in inspiring fashion<br></p><p>In this passionate book, <a href="http://www.thenationalbookreview.com/features/2017/3/28/qa-shining-a-new-light-on-underappreciated-women-artists" title="">Seaman</a> (daughter of artist Elayne Seaman) asks why seven American female artists – Louise Nevelson, Gertrude Abercrombie, Loïs Mailou Jones, Ree Morton, Joan Brown, Christina Ramberg, Lenore Tawney – respected and celebrated in their lifetimes, have been forgotten or nearly so. Seaman resurrects and reanimates. The women come to life here; grouchy, impish, shy, confident, introspective, scrounging and childish. Seaman also provides multiple interpretations of artworks, creating dialogues and instigating conversations that have for so long been missing and discusses how the gender of these accomplished artists led to society forgetting them. This is an inspiring and beautifully written book that will encourage the reader to research further and discover more.</p><p>• <em>Identity Unknown </em>by Donna Seaman is published by Bloomsbury (£25).

Gone by Min Kym review – moving memoir of a former child prodigy

<description>
<p>The story of the gifted virtuoso who grew up to international stardom – and then her beloved violin was stolen</p><p>In <em>Gone</em>, Min Kym’s memoir about her life as a violin soloist, she relates a possibly apocryphal legend about the French violinist Ginette Neveu, who was touring when her plane crashed into a mountain. She died, as did everyone else in the plane. In the wreckage, Neveu’s corpse was discovered with her beloved Stradivarius still gripped in her hand. Kym, like Neveu, was a child prodigy who grew up to be a brilliant professional musician; also like Neveu, Kym played, and loved, a Stradivarius, one of just 449 in the world. But Kym lost her Stradivarius when she was 31 years old, a loss so terrible it left her unable to play the violin.</p><p>From age six, Kym hadn’t gone a day without practising. When she started learning to play the instrument, she “felt like a creature released, alive in herself for the first time”. Even then, she says, “I knew I could play anything. Anything. This was not arrogance – I was a shy child, reluctant to come forward, to give voice, to take centre stage – but more simply that I had found, not only my home and my voice, but my element.” Others agreed. Kym’s chronicle of childhood glitters with the wunderkind’s starry achievements: the first this, the youngest that. Concert soloist at 10 years old. Youngest pupil ever at the prestigious Purcell School. When she was 12, Kym was playing professionally in five to six concerts a year; at 13, she had her debut concerto with the Berlin Symphony Orchestra. She performed with the pianist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/19/vladimir-ashkenazy-brexit-musicians-keep-britain-in-tune">Vladimir Ashkenazy</a>, won prizes, played in Madrid, Seoul, Bologna and Seville.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/gone-by-min-kym-review-moving-memoir-of-a-former-child-prodigy">Continue reading...</a>

Let Go My Hand by Edward Docx review – on the bumpy road to Dignitas
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/21/let-go-my-hand-by-edward-docx-review-dignitas
</link>
<description>
<p>The sense of an ending hangs over this humorous, compassionate novel about a fractious family taking a last road trip together</p><p>It takes chutzpah to argue with Tolstoy but, four novels into his career, Edward Docx has mustered sufficient confidence to take issue with the master. “I’m not sure Tolstoy had it right. All families, happy or sad, conceal a great deal of dark matter. Something greater than the known physics or chemistry, something that must create the dark energy that holds them together or pushes them apart.”</p><p>Docx has earned the right to his opinion: his 2007 Man Booker long-listed novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/21/fiction.featuresreviews1" title=""><em>Self Help</em></a> was a dark-hearted family drama partly set in St Petersburg that deliberately courted comparison with 19th-century Russian epics. In that book, a pair of half-Russian twins were summoned home to deal with the unexpected death of their mother. <em>Let Go My Hand</em> features a part-Russian narrator named Louis and his elder twin half-brothers, who drive across Europe to deal with the death of their father: the twist being that Dad isn’t actually dead yet, but intends to be in the very near future.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/21/let-go-my-hand-by-edward-docx-review-dignitas">Continue reading...</a>

Inside the Wave by Helen Dunmore – generous and contemplative
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/24/inside-the-wave-helen-dunmore-review
</link>
<description>
<p>Reflections on mortality – filtered by the poet’s experience of illness – run through this wide-ranging and consummate collection</p><p>Helen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-dunmore">Dunmore</a> is a much admired and widely read novelist, but she began her writing career as a poet. Many of the strengths of her fiction were already present in her early collections of poems – for example, the capacity to render the physical world as a tangible presence, or her dramatic grasp of how character begins to disclose itself, or the ability to let a story seem to tell itself rather than be explained. She remarked in the early 90s that she was trying “to do without scaffolding” in her poetry, and successive volumes have demonstrated the developing success of that approach.</p><p>The central subject of <em>Inside the Wave</em> is mortality, seen through Dunmore’s experience of cancer. She has made it known that the prognosis is poor. “Pain is yards away / Held off like bad weather”, but the beauty and fascination of the world are undiminished as the continuity of living and dying becomes apparent. There is a tree at the window, or fishermen are seen returning to shore with their catch. There is “the rock where the seaweed clings / And the red anemone throbs in its crevice / Through swash and backwash”. In “The Underworld”, Dunmore notes:</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/24/inside-the-wave-helen-dunmore-review">Continue reading...</a>

Reservoir 13 by Jon McGregor review – an aftermath in elegant slow motion

<description>
<p>In the author’s first novel for seven years, formal experimentation gives way to a delicate, subtle study of the effects of a disappearance on a village’s inhabitants</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/07/jon-mcgregor-reservoir-13-novel-interview" title="">Jon McGregor</a> has been quietly building a reputation as one of the outstanding writers of his generation since 2002, when he became the youngest writer to be longlisted for the Booker prize with his debut, <em>If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things</em>, published when he was 26. <em>Reservoir 13</em> is only his fourth novel, but it confirms his gift as a poet of ordinary lives and his skill in taking risks with form and style.</p><p>After the experimental narrative of 2010’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/21/even-the-dogs-by-jon-mcgregor" title=""><em>Even the Dogs</em></a>, a story of drug and alcohol addiction told in fragmented bursts by a series of urban ghosts, <em>Reservoir 13</em> may seem, at first glance, a more conventional and pastoral novel. This could come as a relief to those who felt the stylistic devices were too much to the fore in its predecessor. But <em>Reservoir 13</em> offers its own subtler experimentation; a short way into the book, it becomes clear that McGregor has succeeded in pulling off one of the most difficult tricks in fiction – a true ensemble piece of storytelling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/23/reservoir-13-jon-mcregor-aftermath-in-slow-motion-review-novel">Continue reading...</a>

Anything Is Possible by Elizabeth Strout review – masterful chronicler of small-town America
</title>

<description>
<p>With her gentle gift for unmasking human vulnerability, Elizabeth Strout has a touch of John Steinbeck and Anne Tyler</p><p>For years, I didn’t read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/07/elizabeth-strout-interview-booker-my-name-is-lucy-barton">Elizabeth Strout</a>. If I’m honest, I was put off by the titles, which seemed to be snatched from the noticeboard of a particularly cultivated old people’s home: <a href="http://www.elizabethstrout.com/books/amy-and-isabelle/"><em>Amy and Isabelle</em></a> was her first novel, published in 1998, and this was followed by <em>Abide With Me</em> in 2006, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/21/pulitzer-elizabeth-strout-fiction"><em>Olive Kitteridge</em></a> two years later and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/20/burgess-boys-elizabeth-strout-review"><em>The Burgess Boys</em></a> in 2013.</p><p>I watched the HBO miniseries adaptation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/16/olive-kitteridge-frances-mcdormand-box-set-review"><em>Olive Kitteridge</em></a>, starring Frances McDormand, and I sort of loved it but wasn’t sure it was worth four whole hours. All of which is a roundabout way of saying that it took me longer than it should have to discover Strout’s writing. It was only with the publication of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/11/my-name-is-lucy-barton-review-elizabeth-strout-emotional-insight"><em>My Name Is Lucy Barton</em></a> last year that I eventually started reading her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/23/anything-is-possible-elizabeth-strout-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An affirmation of the importance of friendship amid oppression, this vivid epic of life in a war zone is woven from the true stories of those who live there</p><p>Since 1980, the people of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq">Iraq</a> have suffered almost ceaseless war, as well as uprisings, repressions, sanctions and conflict-related illness. <em>The President’s Gardens</em>, published in Arabic in 2012 and now masterfully translated by Luke Leafgren, at last provides us with an epic account of this experience from an Iraqi perspective.</p><p>“If every victim had a book, Iraq in its entirety would become a huge library, impossible ever to catalogue.” This novel belongs to Ibrahim, nicknamed “the Fated”, whose life is narrated in the most detail and the discovery of whose head in a banana crate opens and closes the novel in 2006. Ibrahim’s friends since childhood, Tariq “the Befuddled” and Abdullah, known as “Kafka”, are also essential to the story.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/the-presidents-gardens-by-muhsin-al-ramli-review">Continue reading...</a>

Universal Harvester by John Darnielle review – welcome to the great nowhere

<description>
Grief haunts an eerie puzzle box of a story in the second novel from the Mountain Goats frontman, set in the long-gone era of VHS tapes and dial-up<br /><p>We live in an age when much of the fiction we consume is purpose built to not add up. In novels such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/27/acceptance-jeff-vandermeer-trilogy-review" title="">Jeff VanderMeer</a>’s Southern Reach trilogy and Agustín Fernández Mallo’s Nocilla sequence, TV shows such as <em>The OA</em>, <em>Westworld</em> and <em>True Detective</em>, and an increasing number of&nbsp;Hollywood film franchises, we encounter self-consciously labyrinthine and reflexive meta-narratives that end, when they can be said to end&nbsp;at all, in irresolution, deferral and&nbsp;ellipsis. JJ Abrams, the producer and co-creator of <em>Lost</em> who has helped to mainstream the idea of narrative as&nbsp;an&nbsp;endlessly open puzzle-box of allusions and intimations that simultaneously invites and resists exegesis, calls this style <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/j_j_abrams_mystery_box" title="">“the mystery box”</a>. Part&nbsp;of the allure of such narratives is&nbsp;the participatory element: facilitated&nbsp;by social media and online fan forums, every reader and viewer who so desires&nbsp;has the chance to posit themselves as critic, theorist, prophet and de facto co-writer. When stories don’t add up, the speculation can go on&nbsp;for&nbsp;ever.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/15/popandrock1" title="">John Darnielle</a>’s second novel, <em>Universal Harvester</em>, very much fits the contemporary puzzle-box aesthetic. In&nbsp;other respects, it is strikingly and enchantingly out of time. It is set in the&nbsp;late 1990s, in those final few years before civilisation went permanently online. References abound to clunky, unintegrated tech – VHS tapes, basic “burner” cellphones and the laboured gurgle of dial-up home internet – and serve to remind us how quaint the pre-2000s now seem. We are in the town of&nbsp;Nevada, Iowa; the main character is&nbsp;Jeremy Heldt, an unprepossessing video store clerk in his early 20s and an &nbsp;inveterate homebody. Jeremy seems like something of a slacker, but&nbsp;what looks like passivity is only the ceaseless forestalling of unprocessed grief. Jeremy lost his mother in a car crash as a teenager, and since then, he and his father Steve have remained in a&nbsp;kind of permanent holding pattern. Darnielle deftly sketches out their static routines: downing cans of Milwaukee Brew they refer to as “beasts”, making the effort to&nbsp;eat their tacos at the dinner table together “like a real family”, and finishing the evenings off with whatever selection of movies Jeremy has brought home with him. As one of Darnielle’s more lovely phrases has it, the Heldts’ consolingly indistinguishable days “roll on like hills too low to give names to”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/20/universal-harvester-by-john-darnielle-review-mountain-goats">Continue reading...</a>

The Clocks in This House All Tell Different Times by Xan Brooks review – a dark, enchanted debut
</title>

<description>
Set in the aftermath of the first world war, this is a twisted fairytale populated by wounded servicemen, establishment radicals and a ‘discount Aleister Crowley’<p>It’s 1923. Lucy Marsh and her friend Winifred, mid-teenagers from an enclave of dying pubs and dead industries in north-east London, find themselves effectively sold into prostitution by their families. Once a week in Epping Forest they meet with and service four bizarrely wounded ex‑servicemen who have given arms, legs, hands and faces for their country in the recent world war. Lucy isn’t sure if they’re named after Dorothy’s companions in <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>, or if the characters in the story were named after them. The “funny men” seem as decent as they are damaged, puzzled to the point of inarticulacy by the things that have happened to them. But though they’re shy they know what they’ve lost – homes, wives, children, physical comfort, any sense of themselves as welcome in the society that sent them to fight – and they know what they want, at least from Lucy and Winifred.</p><p>Xan Brooks’ first novel quickly normalises both the bizarreness and the unspoken brutality of the situation. Much of this depends on Lucy’s adaptability: throughout, she treats her clients – and indeed everyone she meets – with a kind of bemused generosity. The reader is less tempted. The funny men subsist on the charity of “the Pink Earl”, an establishment radical, and his vile son Rupert Fortnum-Hyde, whose 5,000-acre estate “rolls out on either side of the river Lea”. Their holdings include “a sugar estate in Jamaica, 12 London townhouses and an ongoing stake in the British South Africa Company”. Despite this, both conceive of themselves somehow as socialists; in addition the son presents himself as&nbsp;an experimentalist of human beings, a force for modernity and change. He surrounds himself with a permanent carnival of jazz musicians, confused interwar intellectuals, a “discount <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/15/unseen-aleister-crowley-writings-short-story-the-drug" title="">Aleister Crowley</a>” who has somehow failed to monetise the ability to conjure genuine flames from his fingertips, and&nbsp;a female north African camel called Edith. Everyone but the camel, including Lucy and Winifred, is plied with vast quantities of cocaine, “a drug for action, a drug for doers”, the “taste of the future” – although their only future is to be abandoned the moment Fortnum-Hyde becomes bored.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/20/the-clocks-in-this-house-all-tell-different-times-xan-brooks-m-john-harrison">Continue reading...</a>

The Sport of Kings by CE Morgan review – an epic journey into the deep south
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/19/the-sport-of-kings-by-ce-morgan-review
</link>
<description>
This multigenerational saga, shortlisted for the Pulitzer and now the Baileys prize, explores Darwinism, horse racing and the legacies of slavery<p>This novel is about horse racing the way <em>Moby-Dick</em> is about a whale; it has a similarly expansive scope, spiritual seriousness and density of grand themes. Shortlisted for the Pulitzer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/03/shortlisted-book-women-able-to-kill-men-with-single-touch-baileys-prize">and now the Baileys prize</a>, Morgan’s epic work builds to a climactic series of dramatic race scenes featuring a star filly named Hellsmouth. Along the way, Morgan wrestles with subjects including the history of Kentucky, slavery and its legacies, the iniquities of American healthcare, Darwinism, geology and relations between the sexes. In the maximalist stakes, Morgan’s novel is a muscular, confident entry.</p><p>For the first 200 pages, the book appears to be a conventional multigenerational saga set in the American south. The Forge family are corn famers: in the opening section, hot-headed young Henry Forge, classically tutored and prone to trading arguments in Greek or Latin with his tyrannical father, develops a rebellious ambition to transform their farm one day into a thoroughbred breeding business. “I won’t have you throw everything away for a heap of rhinestones,” rages Henry’s father, when his son blurts out his dream. “There is no need for improvement, Henry, only adherence to a line that has never altered, because it’s never proven unsound.” The story that unfolds will reveal the faults in that Forge line, and an unsoundness at its very heart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/19/the-sport-of-kings-by-ce-morgan-review">Continue reading...</a>

He Said/She Said by Erin Kelly review – creepy, tangled and disturbing
</title>

<description>
<p>Kelly’s latest thriller, about a couple who witness a horrific act, will keep you guessing until the end</p><p>“It’s going to be a classic he said/she said, textbook case decision by jury,” says a reporter in Erin Kelly’s new thriller. “Half the female jurors are already in love with him... It always sounds convincing until the defence cross-examine the victim and they shredded her.”</p><p>Kelly’s <em>He Said/She Said</em> hinges on the alleged rape of Beth Taylor, but the incident is described largely from the perspectives of Laura and Kit, a young couple who have travelled to Lizard Point in Cornwall to watch the 1999 total eclipse of the sun. Eclipses are Kit’s passion, and this is the first he is sharing with Laura. But the experience pales beside what they encounter next: rounding a corner, Laura stumbles upon a couple having sex, the woman’s face contorted, desperate with fear. They call the police and end up testifying as witnesses in court, a decision that, 16 years later, results in them living in fear, hiding their identities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/18/he-said-she-said-erin-kelly-thriller-of-the-month-review">Continue reading...</a>

Reservoir 13 by Jon McGregor review – a chilling meditation on loss and time
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/reservoir-13-by-jon-mcgregor-review
</link>
<description>
<p>The rural village, the missing girl, the search for a body … then life goes on, as an archetypal story is rekindled with explosive results</p><p>Why is it always a girl who’s missing? What is it in that archetype that tugs at us in some deep place – readers and viewers, male and female alike – when yet again the quest begins with news of someone’s daughter who hasn’t come home, or a glimpse of a girl in some place that’s much too lonely, glancing back nervously over her shoulder? We can’t imagine being hooked so easily if the paperback thriller or crime drama began with a missing boy, and the idea of his disappearance wouldn’t transform with the same inevitability into the idea of the boy’s death, the image of it.</p><p>In Jon McGregor’s new novel the missing girl’s name is Rebecca Shaw and she is 13 years old. Rebecca’s family are on holiday in a village in the Peak District, staying in a barn conversion; they have come for the New Year. “When last seen she’d been wearing a white hooded top with a navy-blue body warmer, black jeans and canvas shoes. She was five feet tall, with straight, dark-blond, shoulder-length hair.” The smallness seems part of the drama, too, doesn’t it? Big girls don’t go missing half as often. And the white hooded top, perhaps even the blondness: if this was a film or TV show, that whiteness would be a flash of light between the trees, a brief half-glimpse of something pure and unspoiled, which – the viewer’s already agonised, ahead of the plot – must be brought down and dirtied, crossed with darkness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/reservoir-13-by-jon-mcgregor-review">Continue reading...</a>

Black Moses by Alain Mabanckou review – a picaresque tour-de-force

<description>
<p>A Congolese orphan struggles to escape desperate circumstances in a novel whose ebullient humour has an undertow of grief</p><p>Alain Mabanckou, a writer of ferocious wit and fearless inventiveness, has&nbsp;won acclaim for&nbsp;novels such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/21/broken-glass-mabanckou-review" title=""><em>Broken Glass</em></a>, <em>African Psycho</em> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/17/black-bazaar-alain-mabanckou-review" title=""><em>Black Bazaar</em></a>, which span the Congo-Brazzaville of his birth and the black communities of Paris, where he moved&nbsp;in 1989. In 2012, he won the Académie Française’s grand prix for a&nbsp;lifetime’s achievement. That same year, this UCLA professor returned to his home town of Pointe-Noire, on the Republic of Congo’s equatorial coast, after an absence of 23 years. The memoir <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/translation-tuesdays-by-asymptote-journal/2016/mar/01/excerpt-lights-of-pointe-noire-by-alain-mabanckou" title=""><em>The Lights of Pointe-Noire</em></a> was one fruit of that bittersweet return. His latest novel, <em>Petit Piment</em>, which was shortlisted for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/prix-goncourt" title="">Prix Goncourt</a>, is another. Its English translation as <em>Black Moses</em>, by Helen Stevenson, is justly longlisted for this year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/15/man-booker-international-prize-longlist-amos-oz-ismail-kadare" title="">Man Booker International prize</a>.</p><p>The novel is dedicated to all those “wanderers of the Côte Sauvage” – Pointe-Noire’s urban beach – who told the author “pieces of their life story” during his stay in the port city. Its ebullient humour recalls <em>Tomorrow I’ll Be Twenty</em>, Mabanckou’s fictionalised autobiography of growing up in the 1970s under a Marxist-Leninist regime. Yet unlike in that buoyantly mischievous child’s-eye satire, the laughter here has an undertow of grief, outrage and survivor’s guilt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/14/black-moses-alain-mabanckou-petit-piment-review-helen-stevenson">Continue reading...</a>

All Grown Up by Jami Attenberg review – a New York heroine you can relate to
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/all-grown-up-jami-attenberg-review
</link>
<description>
A wickedly funny and honest portrayal of love, ambition, sex – and the city<p><a href="http://www.jamiattenberg.com/" title="">Jami Attenberg</a>’s fifth novel is her best yet. It’s a super-smart, often extremely funny, sometimes heartbreaking portrait of a 39-year-old, single, child-free heroine in New York City who’s taking her very best shot at living life on her own terms.</p><p>Andrea is far from perfect and far from living the dream, whatever that is – as this novel cleverly demonstrates, the grass isn’t always greener on the other side – but she’s all the more understandable because of it, and, thanks to her dislike of cocktails with “fruit wedges”, all the more likable too. Attenberg’s episodic approach – chapters flit between subjects, from friendship, family, sex and ambition, the chronological narrative winding through them, sometimes to the fore, sometimes in the background – may give the impression of something insubstantial, but the end result is actually the opposite. As angry, sad and raw as it is astute, hilarious and hopeful, <em>All Grown Up</em> puts other novels in this vein to shame.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/all-grown-up-jami-attenberg-review">Continue reading...</a>

The Bagpiping People by Douglas Dunn review – stories of amiable Scots melancholy
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/21/bagpiping-people-douglas-dunn-review-amiable-melancholy
</link>
<description>
<p>This collection of short stories by the poet tells of ruffled lives and people leaving their disapproving villages for Glasgow and beyond</p><p>The poet Douglas Dunn also writes wonderful short stories, some of which are collected together here. The “bagpiping people” of the title story are a Scottish Traveller and his family who make money from playing the pipes to a captive audience waiting for the ferry across the Clyde, but of course the name also refers, a little ironically, to the Scots who are the subject of all the stories. Dunn writes beautifully about the self-awareness of the Scots, having to perform their ethnicity for tourists. In “The Canoes” a group of friends act out the expected “courtesy, our soft-spoken and excellent good manners and clear speech” for a young couple, in the hope of funding an evening in the pub. These are quiet stories of “amiably melancholic” men and women who push against expectations of conformity in their disapproving village communities, finding more exciting relationships in Glasgow and beyond. A recurring motif is the neglected garden that signifies “a&nbsp;demoralised resident within”. These tales of disturbed or merely ruffled lives consistently engage and entertain the reader.</p><p>• <em>The Bagpiping People: Selected Short Stories</em> is published by <a href="http://turnpikebooks.co.uk/latestbook/latest-book/" title="">Turnpike</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/21/bagpiping-people-douglas-dunn-review-amiable-melancholy">Continue reading...</a>

The Walworth Beauty by Michèle Roberts review – London across the centuries
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/21/the-walworth-beauty-by-michele-roberts-review
</link>
<description>
<p>This sensuous ghost story flits between Victorian prostitutes and a modern-day flâneuse</p><p>Part time-slip novel, part ghost story, Michèle Roberts’ latest book flits butterfly-like between 1851 and 2011 to link a man and woman with very different attitudes but perhaps twin souls. Madeleine has been unwillingly retired from her university job teaching literature. A&nbsp;self-confessed flâneuse living in a poky Thames-side flat in the heart of the City, she moves to south London on a&nbsp;whim, settling into a basement in a quiet backwater, Apricot Street. Not far&nbsp;away is the ancient Cross Bones cemetery where “Southwark geese” – prostitutes – are reputedly buried. A&nbsp;critical reader of Victorian social scientist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/16/rereading-henry-mayhew-london-poor" title="">Henry Mayhew</a>, Madeleine is fascinated by the area’s dingy past.</p><p>With any dual narrative, there’s always the risk that one story will prove more compelling than the other. The one about Madeleine, who, like Roberts, is half-French, initially seems the more intriguing: a sixtysomething single woman navigating the 21st-century city with great pluck. With a gay best friend and a taste for red wine, she’s gallant, curious, adventurous and frequently lonely. Joseph Benson, the man who frequents Apricot Street a century and a half earlier, seems that archetypal Victorian creep, the do-gooder whose mission to improve the lot of fallen woman is compromised by his own prurience and hypocrisy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/21/the-walworth-beauty-by-michele-roberts-review">Continue reading...</a>

My Very Own Space by Pippa Goodhart review – a fun bunny tale

<description>
<p>This action-packed story of a rabbit craving his own space will resonate with children wanting a bit of hush</p><p>There’s a telling dedication at the beginning of this new book from <a href="http://www.pippagoodhart.co.uk/about.htm" title="">Pippa Goodhart</a>, the British author best known for her Winnie the Witch series. “For my own little sister, Jo Eddleston”, it reads, “with whom I used to share a bedroom, with lots of love”. It sweetly encapsulates the spirit of this tale about personal space, featuring little rabbit Jack, who gets cross because he wants some peace, but soon craves the companionship of others.</p><p>It’s a story light on words yet bustling with action. From the perky rabbits squished like sardines on to the front cover, to the whirligig opening spread of singing, sneezing, strutting bunnies, you can see why Jack’s in pursuit of a quiet corner. “SHUSH!” he cries in the first line, “I want to look at my book!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/my-very-own-space-pippa-goodhart-review">Continue reading...</a>

This year’s Easter treats swap chocolate eggs for philosophy, and fluffy chicks for JFK, but are no less touching or hilarious for it<p>This Easter, publishers seem to be overlooking fluffy chicks and chocolate&nbsp;eggs in favour of other celebratory wild​life​. But when I took a look at of <a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/du-iz-tak.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article" title=""><strong>Du Iz Tak?</strong></a> by Carson Ellis (Walker £11.99) I wondered at first why anyone would bother to send me a picture book in a foreign language. Then I took a second look. This story is written in “bug language”, an idea that borders on lunacy but is in practice a joy and a quirky triumph. It is enormous fun reading this book aloud and trying to decipher exchanges between talkative insects. The illustrations are as clear as the language is alien. We witness the exuberant construction of a tree – or plant – house that, after a while, sprouts a gladdenboot. A what? A flower, silly. It is a refreshing change from the worthily educational: only the most duty-bound parent could be bugged by this (for ages four and up).</p><p>Every dog you could imagine is contained within the covetable, cloth-bound pocket book<strong> </strong><a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dogs-501256.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article" title=""><strong>Dogs</strong></a> by Emily Gravett (Two Hoots £7.99). It is a book of contrasts that depends for its success on the wonderful skill and humour of the drawings. These are not fantasy dogs – they are based on shrewd, exact and affectionate observation. When she writes: “I love stroppy dogs… and soppy dogs”, she has a huge frowning boxer and a little fluffy cur with a pink&nbsp;ribbon round its neck. Her barking dog is a tiny tearaway and her non-barking dog looks cowardly and so&nbsp;on – exactly as such dogs do. Even her sleeping dogs you would not want to let lie. A disarming pleasure to read (ages two and up).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/16/picture-books-for-children-easter-penguins-pythons-presidents-david-walliams">Continue reading...</a>

The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas review – racism and police brutality
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/08/the-hate-u-give-angie-thomas-review-alex-wheatle
</link>
<description>
<p>An outstanding debut stages the debates convulsing America in the story of a teenager who testifies after a shooting</p><p>“Girls wear their hair coloured, curled, laid, and slayed. Got me feeling basic as hell with my ponytail. Guys in their freshest kicks and sagging pants grind so close to girls they just about need condoms ...” Then gunshots shatter the music. Fleeing from the party, 16-year-old Starr is led to apparent safety by her friend Khalil. Shortly after, their car is pulled over by a police officer. What happens next crystallises the Black Lives Matter movement and indeed, the whole debate about race in America. The unarmed Khalil is murdered – shot at point blank range by the man Starr refers to from this moment on as “Officer One-Fifteen”. Starr is the only witness to the crime and her 16-year-old shoulders have to bear the ferocious outrage of her race and community.</p><p>There's a chilling scene where Starr witnesses a police officer force her father to lie on the ground as he searches him</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/08/the-hate-u-give-angie-thomas-review-alex-wheatle">Continue reading...</a>

Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls review – a real inspiration

<description>
From activists and lawyers to pirates and inventors, Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo present young readers with a lifetime’s supply of brilliant female role models<p>Children’s nonfiction books about women’s lives are a long overdue trend, and this empowering, resolutely “anti-princess” storybook is a very welcome addition. Initially funded by a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timbuktu/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-100-tales-to-dr">$1m Kickstarter campaign</a>, the authors wrote it in response to the gender stereotyping they found across children’s books and media.</p><p>One hundred extraordinary women are profiled in mini biographies alongside striking full-page portraits by female artists. Countries from across the globe are represented, with around a third of the women from the US. Elizabeth I, Ada Lovelace and Jane Austen lead the British entries, which do feel a little predictable – my daughter fruitlessly scanned through for JK Rowling; the most recent entry is Margaret Thatcher – but this is a minor gripe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/04/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-review-inspiring-stuff-elena-favilli-francesca-callo">Continue reading...</a>

<title>The literary tomboy is dead – or is she?</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/03/the-literary-tomboy-enid-blyton-shakespeare
</link>
<description>
<p>From Shakespeare to Enid Blyton, fiction about girls who defy ‘feminine’ stereotypes has itself been pretty stereotypical. But that may be changing </p><p>“I shall only answer if you call me George. I hate being a girl. I won’t be. I don’t like doing the things that girls do. I like doing the things that boys do.”</p><p>These lines in Five on Treasure Island introduce George Kirrin, one of the most famous tomboys in fiction. Enid Blyton’s novel, opening the bestselling Famous Five series, was published in 1942, when expectations of how women should behave were clear-cut and constricting. With her short hair, love of sailing and climbing and insistence on being addressed as “Master George”, she was the opposite of her doll-loving cousin, Anne – whose brother’s description of her as “a very good little housekeeper” in Five Go Off in a Caravan is a source of personal pride.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/03/the-literary-tomboy-enid-blyton-shakespeare">Continue reading...</a>

Scarlett Thomas: Why I was wrong about children’s fiction
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/24/childrens-fiction-scarlett-thomas-dragons-green
</link>
<description>
Once, I banned my students from writing them. Now I see the magic and joy in children’s stories<p>It was a mild early summer’s day, with buttercups everywhere. I was map reading and my partner was driving. We were somewhere in West Sussex, on a country road because I couldn’t cope with the harsh rush of the motorway. I’d recently been ill, and felt strongly that I never wanted to&nbsp;re-enter the normal world, with its clattering trucks, fluorescent litter, hashtags and memes. For the last few weeks I had only been able to read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/pgwodehouse" title="">PG Wodehouse</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/05/dodie-smith-i-capture-the-castle-new-stage-musical" title="">Dodie Smith</a>. So I felt happy in the simple nostalgic calm of the English countryside, with hamlets called things like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Old_Wives_Lees_Village_Hall_02.JPG" title="">Old Wives Lees</a> and roads called Frog Hole Lane.</p><p>And suddenly, just off the A272, was a place called Dragon’s Green.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/24/childrens-fiction-scarlett-thomas-dragons-green">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This clever picture book imagines the secret world of the young Virginia Woolf and her sister Vanessa.

When she took her own life in 1941 she left two suicide notes behind: one for her husband and one for her beloved Vanessa.</p><p>Now with beautiful splashes of colour and witty, uplifting text, the Canadian duo Kyo Maclear and illustrator Isabelle Arsenault imagine the secret childhood world the sisters created, while delicately exploring the theme of depression, in this exceptional picture book for ages 4+, finally published in Britain after its acclaimed release in Canada in 2012.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/21/virginia-wolf-isabelle-arsenault-kyo-maclear-childrens-book-of-the-week">Continue reading...</a>

Every Hidden Thing by Kenneth Oppel review – heat, dust and dinosaur bones
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/11/every-hidden-thing-kenneth-oppel-review
</link>
<description>
<p>Two paleontologists chase the elusive ‘rex’ as their children fall in love in a fast-paced, warts-and-all western</p><p>This breakneck palaeontological western is perhaps best not judged by its cover. A&nbsp;jigsaw dinosaur skeleton seems to welcome younger readers, despite the tagline’s warning that “Love lies buried”; this makes the appearance of sexual attraction (“I felt myself stiffening between my legs”)on page nine slightly disconcerting. But for a reader mature enough to handle the pungent, realistic detail of 19th-century life, it’s a fascinating, fast-paced, rich and provocative novel.</p><p>Appropriately, its author specialises in adventure that takes place on boundaries and frontiers. Kenneth Oppel’s Silverwing trilogy, with its cast of migrating bats, has been compared to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/04/richard-adams-watership-down-interview" title=""><em>Watership Down</em></a>, selling over a million copies worldwide. In steampunk vein, he has written about thousand-car trains crossing Canada in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/08/the-boundless-kenneth-oppel-review" title=""><em>The Boundless</em></a><em>,</em> and 900-ft airships crossing the Pacific in <em>Airborn</em>. Now he has turned his hand to&nbsp;the secrets of prehistory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/11/every-hidden-thing-kenneth-oppel-review">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
Leading literary agent who guided Nobel- and Booker-winning novelists, and paired Roald Dahl with Quentin Blake<p>In 1961, in a lift in Rockefeller Center in New York, a British editor working for Simon &amp; Schuster met a young literary agent. The editor was Gina Conquy; the literary agent was Murray Pollinger, visiting the city on a business trip. This meeting was to have consequences far beyond the personal: from it there resulted not only a long-lasting marriage, but also the forging of a literary agency that discovered and nurtured some of the most successful British writers of the second half of the 20th century.</p><p>The profession of literary agent was still a relatively new one at the time of that meeting. Murray had been born into it: his father, Laurence Pollinger, had been the agent of, among others, DH Lawrence, Graham Greene and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/08/obituaries/john-masters-68-who-wrote-of-the-role-of-british-in-india.html" title="">John Masters</a>, the novelist who wrote about the British in India. Murray worked with the family firm until he set up on his own, running the business from a tiny office in Garrick Street, London. Gina, who has died aged 81, could not have been bettered as a choice of spouse: she had extensive editorial experience and was prepared to take the long view. She also had the necessary warmth and tenacity to guide the neophyte author into the sunny uplands of publication.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/gina-pollinger-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Adam Hargreaves, son of Mr Men creator Roger, discusses the latest expansion of the cartoon universe – into the realm of the Timelord</p><p>Adam Hargreaves remembers exactly when his Dad, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2011/may/09/mr-men-in-pictures">Roger, first created the Mr Men</a>. Then seven years old, the curious young boy asked the kind of question young boys often ask: “Daddy, what does a tickle look like?” So Roger started sketching, perhaps not realising that he was founding a globe-spanning, £28m empire that would be going strong decades later. That first book, Mr Tickle, was published in 1971. “I think he started to realise he was on to something,” chuckles Hargreaves Jr.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/25/mr-men-doctor-who-adam-roger-hargreaves-cartoon-timelord">Continue reading...</a>

Hot guys wanted: Chris Evans, Tom Hardy … who's next for CBeebies Bedtime Stories?

<p>As the BBC’s parental-respite service continues its fine tradition of giving mums something pretty to look at, we ask who can follow Captain America</p><p>Chris Evans is going to read a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/cbeebies">CBeebies</a> Bedtime Story soon. Actual Captain America, from all three thousand <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/captain-america-civil-war">Captain America</a> films, will sit down and lull the nation’s toddlers to sleep with a sonorous reading of Even Superheroes Have Bad Days by Shelly Becker and Eda Kaban on 10 May.</p><p>Admittedly this is probably more interesting to parents than toddlers. My two-year-old, largely speaking, doesn’t care about the box office grosses of the people reading stories to him. He’s over the moon if they happen to be <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b07k55cw/cbeebies-bedtime-stories-549-nadiya-hussain-my-little-star">softly spoken and sincere like Nadiya Hussain</a> from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off">Great British Bake Off</a>, and actively less over the moon when, say, David Hasselhoff ends up bellowing a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01pw55b/cbeebies-bedtime-stories-333-david-hasselhoff-jacks-tractor">broken assembly line of words</a> that sound as if they’ve been phonetically translated from Esperanto on cue cards held slightly too far away to be comfortably read.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/apr/24/cbeebies-bedtime-stories-chris-evans-tom-hardy-bbc">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
<p>The prolific Australian author talks about her new novel, Miss Lily’s Lovely Ladies, and writing women into history</p><p>Australian author Jackie French stopped counting how many books she’d written after she reached 100 – and that was 13 years ago. Her latest novel, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com.au/9781460753583/">Miss Lily’s Lovely Ladies</a> (released concurrently with <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com.au/9781460751787/">Millie Loves Ants</a>, her latest children’s book), is first in a series that examine women’s changing roles in the 20th century.<br></p><p> Beginning in 1902, the novel follows Sophie Higgs, an Australian heiress of a corned beef factory, who attends a London finishing school for young women. The mysterious Miss Lily believes that a woman’s power lies in her ability to influence men. Under her tutelage, Sophie begins an extraordinary adventure across the Western front, and into the drawing rooms of powerful men. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/18/jackie-french-to-be-a-woman-in-power-now-you-need-to-be-better-than-men">Continue reading...</a>

Having witnessed the death of her two best friends makes Starr older than her years, and her regular teenage path of dating, basketball, studying and sleepovers is dotted with landmine-like dilemmas. Should she speak out about the latest shooting by a police officer? Should her family move to the suburbs? Can they stay true to their community and escape the worst effects of gang culture? Can her white boyfriend ever really understand her life? Starr and her many readers will keep asking the big questions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/16/teenage-fiction-reviews-angie-thomas-tanya-landman">Continue reading...</a>

Fiction for 8- to 12-year-olds reviews – cyborgs, sisters and a girl called Owl

Film directors Sylvain Chomet and Bobbie Peers give a fantastic spin to the challenges of the tweenage years, alongside vlogging cats and talking fish<p>Picture books for key stage 2 readers require a balance of graphics and grist – too cute and you’ll insult their sense of maturity. Dancing across the divide from picture- to text-led is Abby Hanlon’s anarchic <a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dory-fantasmagory.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article"><strong>Dory Fantasmagory</strong></a> (Faber £6.99), for the very youngest in this range.</p><p>Poor Dory: nobody wants to play with a kid sister whose imagination is matched by her pestiferousness. Hanlon’s cartoons add devilment to the narrative, mostly set in Dory’s imagination. Her siblings make up a baby-stealing bogeywoman to scare her; Dory responds by darting Mrs Gobble Gracker with sedatives. Very funny.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/16/childrens-fiction-review-sylvain-chomet-bobbie-peers-chloe-daykin-abby-hanlon-amy-wilson-rae-earl">Continue reading...</a>

Francesca Segal: ‘I think there are multiple awkward ages’

</link>
<description>
The award-winning novelist on life’s transitional stages, and her father – the man who wrote Love Story<p>Francesca Segal was born in 1980 in north-west London, where she lives today. Her debut novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/24/francesca-segal-innocents-review" title=""><em>The Innocents</em></a>, won the 2012 Costa first novel award and the Betty Trask award. Her new novel, <a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/awkward-age-489718.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article" title=""><em>The Awkward Age</em></a>, tells a story about reconstituted families and the lengths to which parents will go to ensure their child’s happiness.</p><p><strong><em>The Awkward Age</em> is about a fifty-something couple on their second relationship, cohabiting with their two teenage children. What appealed to you about this scenario?</strong><br>I thought it was rich with tension and comic possibilities. It’s what more than 50% of families in this country look like. And that noble lunacy of constructing two halves that were never designed to fit together – it’s beautiful, sad, touching and intriguing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/23/francesca-segal-meet-the-author-the-awkward-age-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<title>Richard Ford: ‘Who needs friends?’</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/richard-ford-do-we-really-need-friends
</link>
<description>
<p>Is friendship really all it’s cracked up to be, asks the US novelist</p><p>And if they ever put a bullet through your brain, I’ll complain. It’s friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship … <strong>Cole Porter</strong></p><p>The jury’s out on friendship. It’s not the cynical and acrimonious age of Trump that brings friendship to my mind (though can you imagine our president ever, really having a friend?). It’s me. <em>I’ve</em> been brooding about friendship. Now and then, don’t we need to think hard about our presumed institutions? “A friend is the hope of the heart,” Emerson wrote. “A masterpiece of nature.” I’m not sure. “I sometimes wonder,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/philiplarkin">Philip Larkin</a> wrote to his girlfriend, “if anyone can do anything for anyone.” You know something sceptical’s afoot when you find Larkin on your bedside table instead of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/10/montaigne-philosophy">Montaigne</a> and La Rochefoucauld.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/richard-ford-do-we-really-need-friends">Continue reading...</a>

Warren Ellis: 'Now everything is insane and I’m loving it'

<description>
<p>The comics cult hero explains why he’s a disappointed optimist and reflects on the fresh relevance of his 90s hit Transmetropolitan in the age of Trump</p><p>No matter what happens, Warren Ellis is never without his sense of humour. “You remember that bit in the last series of The Thick of It, when Malcolm Tucker orchestrates a political coup and says: ‘Thank God, I’ve been so fucking bored for the last three years?’” he says. “I have to consider the possibility that I’m just a horrible sociopath, because I’ve been so fucking bored for the last few years and now everything is insane and I’m loving it.”</p><p>Despite a dauntingly long list of more recent projects – his New York Times-bestselling novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/31/gun-machine-warren-ellis-review">Gun Machine</a>, writing several TV shows including Netflix’s upcoming <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/02/10/wait-netflix-is-making-a-castlevania-show/#53ac4c6f4439">Castlevania</a>, and the Hollywood adaptations of his comics <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Iron-Man-Extremis-TPB-Graphic-Novel-Pb/0785122583">Iron Man: Extremis</a> (which became the film Iron Man 3) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_(WildStorm)">Red</a> (which became the eponymous comedy starring Helen Mirren) among them – it is one of Ellis’s older works that has rocketed back into relevance. <a draggable="true" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/mar/07/transpolitan-90s-comic-donald-trump-transmetropolitan-warren-ellis">His comic Transmetropolitan</a>, which ran from 1997 to 2002, follows journalist Spider Jerusalem, who wages war with a crooked US president, Gary “The Smile” Callahan. Equal parts sci-fi and sociopolitical commentary, Transmetropolitan is known as one of Ellis’s funniest titles – and, starting with Jerusalem’s literal descent from a mountain to try to talk revolution into an apathetic population, it is freshly topical.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/17/warren-ellis-now-everything-is-insane-and-im-loving-it">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
The prize-winning author on her second novel and the pressures of early success<p>Lisa McInerney is an Irish novelist and short story writer. Her debut novel, <em>The Glorious Heresies</em>, won the Baileys prize for fiction and&nbsp;the Desmond Elliott prize. Her new novel, <em>The Blood Miracles</em>, revisits the characters from&nbsp;her debut in a story that is vivid, compelling&nbsp;and moving.</p><p><strong>Your protagonist, Ryan, is a drug dealer&nbsp;with hidden depths: a young man&nbsp;who, in a different social context, might have had a better life. </strong><br>Yes, absolutely. For me, this is my background as well. I do need to stress&nbsp;I’m a working-class writer, so I’ve met a lot of people like that: who have made one stupid turn and found&nbsp;themselves fighting the consequences for years afterwards. People who are super-smart and very talented. I’ve known people who’ve done appalling things and the person who suffered most was&nbsp;them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/16/lisa-mcinerney-i-have-known-people-who-have-done-appalling-things-meet-the-author-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<title>Donna Leon: Why I became an eco-detective writer</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/donna-leon-interview-commissario-brunetti-earthly-remains
</link>
<description>
<p>On the 25th anniversary of her first crime novel, the Commissario Brunetti author reveals how she is responding to dark times</p><p>Cultured, shrewd, honest and fit Commissario Guido Brunetti – the more-or-less-ideal man who is the hero of <a href="http://www.donnaleon.net/" title="">Donna Leon</a>’s hugely successful series of 26 detective novels set in Venice – begins her latest book <a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/earthly-remains.html" title=""><em>Earthly Remains</em></a> by faking a heart attack. Pushed beyond his limits in an interview with a high-end lawyer suspected of a crime, and who he believes his favourite junior colleague, Pucetti, is about to punch, Brunetti gasps for breath, collapses on his friend and ends up on the floor.</p><p>It is a wild gesture by the&nbsp;policeman who is more often in elegantly attired control. But it is characteristic, too, in that chivalry and protectiveness – both for the lawyer’s young female victim and for his younger colleague – are the immediate cause. Brunetti, as this novel opens, can’t take any more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/donna-leon-interview-commissario-brunetti-earthly-remains">Continue reading...</a>

Tim Parks: ‘The athlete has a training schedule, the actor a script, the writer has nothing'
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/my-writing-day-tim-parks
</link>
<description>
<p>The author on guilty time out, online distractions and getting into ‘the zone’</p><p>It’s a performance. You must never forget that. However much thinking and research come beforehand, however much editing and correction afterwards, the actual writing is performance. There is a moment when you have to do it. You have to put down the rhythms of the voice you’re searching for, you have to find the right succession of detail and event, description and dialogue. Get it wrong and no amount of fiddling will salvage the situation.</p><p>So your problem, as you plan your writing day is, how can I get myself “in the zone”; how can I arrive, for however short a time, at my peak performance? An athlete has her training schedule, the date of the event stamped in her mind, the excitement of the crowded stadium to trigger her best. An actor has his script, his rehearsals and, when it matters, the glare of the lighted stage. The writer has nothing. Hence all the mad little rituals we hear about, having to use a 4H pencil, a Moleskine notebook, having to be in a particular spot, in a certain room, at exactly this time of day, drinking this kind of tea, smoking this brand of cigarette. All desperate attempts to propitiate inspiration, to have ordinariness and originality somehow intersect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/my-writing-day-tim-parks">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whitehead’s award-winning sixth novel, The Underground Railroad, not only packs a punch, it demonstrates a new kind of creative freedom</p><p>“It is a very pleasing thing to watch a writer you have enjoyed for years reach an even higher level of achievement,” wrote Colson Whitehead in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/books/review/lincoln-in-the-bardo-george-saunders.html?_r=0">New York Times</a> recently. “To observe him or her consolidate strengths, share with us new reserves of talent and provide the inspiration that can only come from a true artist charting hidden creative territory.” He was reviewing <em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em>, George Saunders’ first novel, but many of Whitehead’s fans will feel the same way this week, after <em><a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/underground-railroad-495349.html">The Underground Railroad</a></em> scooped a Pulitzer prize to add to the author’s National Book Award – making this the only novel to complete that particular double since Annie Proulx’s <em>The Shipping News</em>, back in 1994.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/09/the-underground-railroad-by-colson-whitehead-review-american-slavery">The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead review – the brutal truth about American slavery</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/14/why-colson-whitehead-deserved-to-win-the-pulitzer-prize-in-fiction">Continue reading...</a>

Nadeem Aslam: ‘I take delight that my initials in Urdu look like a pen by an inkwell’

<p>The novelist on sleeping through the afternoon, working through the night and capturing real-life events in fiction</p><p>I sleep in the afternoon and evening and get up at 11pm. I am at my desk at midnight and I write until six or seven in the morning. I have been working this way for 25 years now. The quietness deepens at night and everything feels saturated with stillness. From 7am till midday, I read. It is often said human beings don’t come with an instruction manual; but I believe that books – libraries – are the instruction manuals for human beings. To read a great book is to realise that everything is already known. I also look at the newspapers. Many things in my books come from real life; but a novelist has to be careful in transporting a real event into the landscape of a novel. It is patient work, like moving a lake from one place to another with a teaspoon.</p><p>I go for a walk in the farmlands and orchards near my house. Insects and birds appear and disappear with the seasons. On the hilltop there are remains of a late bronze age fort. There is a wood full of bluebells in April. I climb down into the valley and enter the neighbourhood I grew up in, a cluster of mainly Muslim working-class streets, here in Yorkshire. It has produced dozens of doctors over the decades, as well as nurses and lawyers, dentists, teachers, drug smugglers, pimps, happy and bitterly unhappy arranged marriages, many of them between first cousins, and there are men and women I went to school with now under arrest for running sweatshops for migrant workers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/08/my-writing-day-nadeem-aslam-books">Continue reading...</a>

Jon McGregor: ‘I’m allergic to trying to make points in fiction’

<description>
The prizewinning novelist and short story writer on capturing daily rural life and&nbsp;the joy of a bad review<p>Jon McGregor’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/even-the-dogs-jon-mcgregor" title="">first novel in seven years</a> opens with a desperate search for a 13-year-old girl, vanished on a moor in the Peak District in the depths of winter. The police scramble helicopters and divers; a search party sweeps the hillside; a press conference is called. But beginnings can be deceptive. <a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/reservoir-13.html" title=""><em>Reservoir 13</em></a> is not a crime novel but a meticulous, slow-burning record of the rhythms of life, death and renewal in a village over the 13 years following the visiting girl’s disappearance. Children are born, old people die, and the youngsters who befriended “Rebecca, Becky or Bex” before she vanished grow to adulthood while she remains frozen in time.</p><p>“I’m sure there will be people who feel hoodwinked in some way,” McGregor admits, wryly. Turning 41 this year, he is a slight man with a bone-dry sense of humour (having been runner-up in the BBC national short story award two years running, he describes himself as “Britain’s second-best short story writer”). But though he set out to play with the expectations raised by his opening scenario – “it’s like if you have a gun on the table, it has to be fired by the third act” – the crime element “was never the point of the story for me”. The point, instead, is that after the initial crisis, normal life resumes, in all its messy particularity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/07/jon-mcgregor-reservoir-13-novel-interview">Continue reading...</a>

From high society to surrealism: in praise of Leonora Carrington – 100 years on

<description>
<p>With her paintings and tales based on dreams, animals and the occult, Carrington was an uncanny original. Marina Warner salutes the artist on her centenerary</p><p>In the mid-1980s, Leonora Carrington was living for a while in New York, in a small single room in a basement in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramercy_Park">Gramercy Park</a> area; she worked at a table between her bed and the kitchenette, clearing away the crucibles of tempera, brushes and palette to cook for herself and, sometimes, for guests who had tracked her down as I had. She had chosen to live below street level because that is where she felt safe, and she was very content with her modest setting. Among the many animals in her paintings and writings are badgers and raccoons and other builders of lairs and burrows; like them, she preferred to keep her feet firmly on solid ground, as if needing an anchorage while her mind spun off on its wild flights.</p><p>The surrealist artist of words and images was then in her 70s, small and thin, with very dark round eyes that still radiated the feral beauty of her youth, and a smoky voice filled with energy and humour. Here was a celebrated, indeed notorious figure; she could have been a <em>monstre sacré</em>. Yet she was exceptionally free from vanity and envy, from craving wealth or flattery or any other signs of worldly status (it’s significant, I think, that in one of those surrealist questionnaires that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/apr/14/art.artsfeatures">André Breton</a> loved devising, Narcissus came last among her favourite myths).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/06/leonora-carrington-from-high-society-to-surrealism-in-praise-of-100-years-on">Continue reading...</a>

Raja Shehadeh: ‘Once people experience liberation, it’s not easily forgotten’

<description>
The outspoken Palestinian lawyer and author on reaching out to the young, political change in the Middle East and his optimism about the future<p>Raja Shehadeh is a Palestinian lawyer and the author of several acclaimed books. His latest, <em>Where The Line Is Drawn: Crossing Boundaries in Occupied Palestine</em>, is written through the prism of his close but problematic relationships with several Israelis. It is at once personal, political, angry, conciliatory and alive to the tensions and shared values of friendships in a divided land. He lives in Ramallah in the West Bank.</p><p><strong>Your book features a long and sometimes troubled friendship with Henry, a Canadian Jew who lives in Israel. In some respects it symbolises the conflict between Israel and Palestine, and you are quite critical of Henry. What does he think of it?</strong><br>Inevitably the symbolism is there but I hate it because I have a special relationship with Henry. He hasn’t read the book yet. I’m quite sure it will mean an extension and improvement in our relationship, although you never know with Henry. He knows about the book. He gave his permission to use our correspondence. I want to spend a whole day with him discussing the book.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/02/raja-shehadeh-where-the-line-is-drawn-meet-the-author-interview">Continue reading...</a>

Howard Jacobson: ‘Trump in the White House – that must never feel normal’

<description>
<p>In the early hours as the US election result became apparent, the novelist was at his desk beginning his satirical novel about the president, Pussy. He’s angry, frustrated – and don’t tell him to get over it</p><p>From the moment Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president">announced he was running for president</a>, the flood of words about the orange-faced reality-TV star and alleged property billionaire has been incessant. And it only increased after he actually became president. But those words have been factual, or at least purport to be factual, no matter how absurd and unbelievable the Trump story has often appeared. What no one has done is write fiction about this most fictional of real-life characters. Until now.</p><p>I thought he’d be shot or impeached before his inauguration</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/02/howard-jacobson-pussy-interview-trump-in-white-house-must-never-feel-normal">Continue reading...</a>

Drinking too many coffees with the great Russian poet Joseph Brodsky

<description>
<p>It was 1974 and tension was high between the Soviets and Americans. The dissident poet Joseph Brodsky and the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov met in New York and had a lot to talk about</p><p>I first met the poet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/04/less-than-one-joseph-brodsky-review" title="">Joseph Brodsky</a> at a dinner in New York in early autumn 1974. I&nbsp;had just escaped from the Soviet Union, and he had been thrown out of the country two years before. After the dinner we went to a&nbsp;café in Greenwich Village. I&nbsp;remember drinking so many espressos – something I wasn’t used to – that I couldn’t fall asleep afterwards because of the heartbeat.</p><p>Actually the heartbeat was not only due to the coffee. “I think we have a&nbsp;lot to talk about,” said Joseph. We&nbsp;did. We both came from Leningrad and had many friends, acquaintances and experiences in common. We talked about where I had lived during my 10 years in Leningrad, and Joseph knew every spot. He was fascinated by architecture – specifically the canals, arches, bridges and Italianate palaces of Leningrad refracted into abstraction by the ripples of the Neva River. I remember his eyebrows going up when I said my last apartment had been near the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jul/10/heritage" title="">Hermitage</a>, just across the Moika River from the house where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/06/alexander-pushkin-hero-elaine-feinstein" title="">Pushkin</a> lived and died. He said, with an ironic grin: “And we left all that beauty…”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/02/brush-with-greatness-joseph-brodsky-mikhail-baryshnikov-ballet-poetry-soviets">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Celebrating 20 years since owner Valerie took over, Blue Willow Bookshop is equally split between adults and children’s books, and staffed with knowledgable booksellers who can do anything - including fixing vacuum cleaners</p><ul><li>Interview with a Bookstore from <a href="http://lithub.com/">Literary Hub</a> is part of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/guardian-books-network">Guardian Books Network</a> <br></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Scroll down for the staff recommendations shelf</strong></li></ul><p>In 1995, Valerie Koehler moved back to Houston, her hometown, from California. A few days after finding the right house, she was driving down Memorial and she remembered the bookstore on the corner, Musabelle’s Books. An idea popped into her head that she might want to run a bookstore, so she stopped in and offered to work Musabelle’s Books for free. Musabelle Naut was not one to turn down free. Within a few months, it became obvious that it was time for Musabelle to retire and sell the shop. And there Valerie was, ready to buy it. It became official in October 1996 and <a href="http://www.bluewillowbookshop.com/">Blue Willow Bookshop</a> has since celebrated 20 years. The shop has changed in some big ways over the years, but it still retains the quirky charm that apparently screams You’ve Got Mail to pretty much every new customer.</p><p><strong>What’s your favourite section of the store?</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/09/interview-with-a-bookstore-blue-willow-bookshop-in-houston">Continue reading...</a>

Literary mixtape: Jason Diamond's perfect teen movie soundtrack

<p>Having once attempted to track down John Hughes and write his biography, Jason Diamond is a huge fan of teen movies. Here, the author of Searching for John Hughes curates the perfect film soundtrack</p><p>By Jason Diamond for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/literary-mixtapes-by-electric-literature">Literary Mixtapes by Electric Literature</a>, part of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/guardian-books-network">Guardian Books Network</a></p><p>I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about teen films, specifically the movies John Hughes made in the 1980s. I spent so much time obsessing over them that at some point in my twenties I tried to write a biography of the director, but it never panned out. I write about that in my memoir, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29099281-searching-for-john-hughes"><em>Searching for John Hughes</em>,</a> but I also write about why his films, and other films with teen protagonists — from <em>Heathers</em> to <em>Dope</em> — have always appealed to me. A big part of it is the music.</p><p>A perfect example is a scene in one of my favourite movies, <em>Over the Edge</em>, where the main character, Carl, is lying in bed, blasting Cheap Trick’s Surrender in his headphones. It’s so simple, but to me it’s one of the best moments in any teen film I can think of. The song fits so perfectly into a moment that we all experienced in high school (and maybe even still experience as adults), just sitting around listening to music and daydreaming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/literary-mixtapes-by-electric-literature/2016/dec/22/literary-mixtape-jason-diamonds-perfect-teen-movie-soundtrack">Continue reading...</a>

‘It captures a time before Dad became a public figure’: at home with Seamus Heaney

<p>Catherine Heaney remembers gatecrashing her poet father’s kitchen photoshoot</p><p>This picture was taken when I was six years old. The photographer, Geray Sweeney, had come to our home in Dublin to take a portrait of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/seamusheaney">my father</a> for an exhibition on Northern Irish poets. I happened to be in the kitchen with my jar of bubbles as she was setting up, and she just started shooting. Clearly nothing was going to distract me from my task.</p><p>I don’t recall the occasion, but, looking at the photograph now, I have an almost physical memory of everything I’m wearing or touching. The beaded necklace was a gift from a family friend and I still have it in a jewellery box somewhere. The cardigan was knitted by my mum and was a bright, cherry red. But most of all, I remember my green bubble pipe. It made big, luxuriant bubbles – far superior to the little ones you’d get from the wands in bottles. My brother says it looks like a crack pipe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/24/captures-time-before-dad-public-figure-catherine-heaney-father-seamus">Continue reading...</a>

Lissa Evans: how my novel about film-making was turned into a film

<description>
My wartime story, Their Finest Hour and a Half, has been adapted for the big screen – seeing actors playing actors and a fake film crew being directed by a real one was surreal<p>I’ve had two jobs in which periods of boredom were punctuated by frenetic, tension-ridden activity. One was as an A&amp;E doctor, and the other as a TV comedy producer. Clearly, it would be fatuous to compare treating a road accident victim to changing a camera shot so as not to reveal the presence of a giant pork pie (which would otherwise spoil a subsequent gag), but the ludicrous thing is that, when you’re doing it, when you’re there, the stakes seem almost as high. As George Arliss, a 1930s film star, once wrote: “When work begins in the studio, nothing that happens in the outside world is of any relative importance.”</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/20/their-finest-review-bill-nighy-gemma-arterton-lone-scherfig">Their Finest review – Bill Nighy, Gemma Arterton and a very British kind of magic</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/lissa-evans-how-my-book-about-film-making-was-turned-into-a-film">Continue reading...</a>

Violent spring: The nature book that predicted the future
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/the-peregrine-by-ja-baker-nature-writing
</link>
<description>
<p>Robert Macfarlane remembers JA Baker’s The Peregrine – a fierce, ecstatic, prophetic account of one man’s obsession that has held readers in its talon-like grip for 50 years</p><p>JA Baker’s <em>The Peregrine</em> is 50 years old, but it feels as if it were written yesterday. In the half century since its publication, this fierce little book has only tightened its talon grip on us. It reads now as uncannily prophetic: of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth">Anthropocene</a> (our geological age, in which human activity is now the dominant influence on the environment), of extinction events, of dark ecology – even of virtual reality. In ancient Rome a <em>haruspex</em> was a person trained in a form of divination based on inspecting the entrails of sacrificed animals. Baker’s book – strewn as it is with eviscerated birds, obsessed as it is with prediction – is a text of killing and foretelling: of seeing the future in blood and guts. It has haruspicated our present, and I suspect its prescience is not yet all used up. </p><p>The story of <em>The Peregrine</em>’s writing is remarkable, and has a mystery at its heart. For around a decade – from 1954 to 1964 – a myopic office worker from Essex tracked the peregrine falcons that hunted over the landscape of his county. He pursued them on bicycle and on foot, watching through binoculars as they bathed, flew, stooped and roosted. He carried Ordnance Survey maps on which he marked in ballpoint pen the locations of his sightings, with circled capital letters – P, SH, HH, BO – recording raptors by species (M is for Merlin, K is for Kestrel). He learned to predict the peregrines’ locations by means of an intelligence that began as logic and ended as instinct, and in a relationship that began as fascination and ended as obsession.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/the-peregrine-by-ja-baker-nature-writing">Continue reading...</a>

<title>The fallen woman: prostitution in literature</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/14/the-fallen-woman-prostitution-in-literature
</link>
<description>
<p>The commodification of sex has fascinated writers, playwrights and painters for centuries – but for all the supposed liberation of our times, have attitudes really changed that much?</p><p>In the past, women whose lives included selling sex were rarely the subjects of their own histories, but were glamorous, vicious or pitiable objects in others’ accounts. One particular alluring figure turns up in the Christian story of sin, redemption and resurrection recounted in the frescoes of medieval western art. Mary Magdalene, the former prostitute, recognisable by her rippling yellow hair and red cloak, kneels at the foot of the cross, weeping. A mythical figure conflated from three different characters in the Gospels, she also turns up in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>.</p><p>Renaissance painters loved her. Their images ostensibly defend Christian notions of chaste female sanctity, but simultaneously celebrate the seductiveness of beauty. They painted her costumed as a temptress in furs and jewels, with luscious breasts exposed, and also as a repentant sinner stripped of her finery, with an animal skin thrown over her, only partly hiding her luminous nakedness. Thirty years ago, similarly inspired, I wrote my novel <em>The Wild Girl</em>, claiming Mary Magdalene as a prophet, the author of a fifth Gospel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/14/the-fallen-woman-prostitution-in-literature">Continue reading...</a>

Pics Or It Didn't Happen: reclaiming Instagram's censored art
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/10/pics-or-it-didnt-happen-reclaiming-instagrams-censored-art
</link>
<description>
<p>The authors of a book curating 270 images that Instagram censored explain why they are making them visible again</p><p>Early in March 2015, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/26/rupi-kaur-poetry-canada-instagram-banned-photo">artist and poet Rupi Kaur</a> uploaded a picture to Instagram of herself in her room, wearing jogging bottoms stained with menstrual blood. Lying with her back to the camera in a nondescript bedroom, nothing about the image was strange. A few days later, Kaur found her image had been removed, so she reposted it. A few days after that, it was removed again. This time she found out why: Instagram’s moderators had deleted the picture for “violation of community standards”. Kaur responded with a rallying post on her Facebook and Tumblr accounts that was shared 11,000 times. “We will not be censored,” she wrote.</p><p>Kaur’s photograph is just one of the 270 deleted images featured in <a href="https://prestelpublishing.randomhouse.de/book/Pics-or-It-Didnt-Happen/Arvida-Bystroem/Prestel/e509336.rhd">Pics Or It Didn’t Happen</a>, a contemporary art book by digital artists Arvida Byström and Molly Soda that brings the pictures Instagram have removed back into the spotlight. But the book is about much more than simply shocking us with controversial pictures; both Byström and Soda agree that some level of social media censorship is needed. “I do understand why censorship exists. I’m not ‘free the nipple’ because I don’t give a shit about that,” Soda says. “But I do think that females presenting bodies are going to be censored more – as they’re always going to be in conversation with sex – no matter what the topic of the photo is.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/10/pics-or-it-didnt-happen-reclaiming-instagrams-censored-art">Continue reading...</a>

<title>Robert Pirsig obituary</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/robert-pirsig-obituary
</link>
<description>
Author of the 1970s cult bestseller Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance<p>When, in 1968, Robert Pirsig, who has died aged 88, sent a synopsis and sample of his novel Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance to 122 publishers, only one showed any interest, and James Landis, the editor who responded from William Morrow, warned him not to expect either a large advance or big sales. But within a month Pirsig set off on his Honda Super Hawk, accompanied by his young son, Chris, and friends John and Sylvia Sutherland, on the 17-day journey from Minneapolis to San Francisco that, six years, two drafts and some 700,000 words later, became the basis of an immediate bestseller. Millions of readers were drawn to this guidebook for the transition of a culture from the rebellious 1960s to the “me generation” of the 70s.</p><p>George Steiner’s New Yorker review, titled Uneasy Rider, famously compared the book to Herman Melville’s sprawling masterpiece <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick" title="">Moby-Dick</a>; other reviewers mentioned Thoreau, whose American transcendentalism also sought to link everyday life and the metaphysical. In a road novel in the spirit of Jack Kerouac’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/02/100-best-novels-no-76-on-the-road-jack-kerouac" title="">On the Road</a>, Pirsig drew on the aphoristic humour of hippy writers such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/sep/23/prose-poetry-brilliance-of-richard-brautigan" title="">Richard Brautigan</a>. “Metaphysics is a restaurant where they give you a 30,000-page menu and no food,” he wrote.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/robert-pirsig-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<title>The end of capitalism has begun</title>

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/17/postcapitalism-end-of-capitalism-begun
</link>
<description>
<p>Without us noticing, we are entering the postcapitalist era. At the heart of further change to come is information technology, new ways of working and the sharing economy. The old ways will take a long while to disappear, but it’s time to be utopian</p><p>The red flags and marching songs of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/syriza">Syriza</a> during the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis">Greek crisis</a>, plus the expectation that the banks would be nationalised, revived briefly a 20th-century dream: the forced destruction of the market from above. For much of the 20th century this was how the left conceived the first stage of an economy beyond capitalism. The force would be applied by the working class, either at the ballot box or on the barricades. The lever would be the state. The opportunity would come through frequent episodes of economic collapse.</p><p>Instead over the past 25 years it has been the left’s project that has collapsed. The market destroyed the plan; individualism replaced collectivism and solidarity; the hugely expanded workforce of the world looks like a “proletariat”, but no longer thinks or behaves as it once did.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/17/postcapitalism-end-of-capitalism-begun">Continue reading...</a>
